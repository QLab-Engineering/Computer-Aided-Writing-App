Saturday afternoon, referee Karl Hess ejected two former N.C. State greats — former NBAer Tom Gugliotta and Chris Corchiani — from the Wolfpack's game against Florida State. Hess refused to answer why he tossed two fans from the game. That's just another example of the officials flexing their muscle, but with no accountability. We're not asking that all officials — the majority of whom do an excellent job under tough circumstances — explain every decision, but there needs to be a system put into place where questions can be asked or things explained. It will make everyone's lives much easier. In the instance on Saturday, what is the harm in explaining why Gugliotta and Corchiani were tossed? Or more commonly, where is the downside in giving the reasoning behind a disputed foul call at the end of a game? There is none. Officials — like coaches and players — should enter the realm of having a forum answer tough questions when the situations call for it.
“We felt that today’s deal provided us the opportunity to acquire several players that are at or near Major League ready and we could control for five to six years, all of whom have upside potential,” Zduriencik said. “We believe it improves the construction of our Major League roster by adding a right-handed bat and a left-handed arm immediately, and thanks to the young arms we have in our minor league system, we believe that we were able to add talent to our organization while dealing from an area of depth.

Still, possessing a live Snakehead is against the law, punishable by a fine of up to $500, depending on previous offenses.
So you're British, and you're ticked off that the mayor of London, currently up for re-election, is refusing to debate opponents. How do you express your distaste with this? Why, you dress in a chicken suit and chase a mayor lookalike around town. And you make it clear that this will keep happening until the mayor caves. Personally, we like this approach way better than the junk mail attack ads we get in this country.

For others, it's the trilogy's exploration of such modern concerns as overpopulation and limited resources that intrigues.

The Knicks could have brought their best game to Miami, but they still would have lost Game 2, because they are hopelessly overmatched. The Heaters were sharp Monday night.

The Von Bondies last released an album five years ago, around the time that this decade's garage-rock revival was petering out. What then to make of "Love Hate and Then There's You," which mainly flogs the same formula as its predecessor? Once more we find singer/guitarist Jason Stollsteimer pushing catchy anguish and drummer Don Blum pounding his way to rapture. The riffs are tight, but not so fresh. When they don't evoke vintage Von Bondies, they suggest the Killers or, in the case of a dramatic lead single, "Pale Bride," the British band Bloc Party.

Cell phone makers often give U.S. carriers exclusive rights to sell a model, but usually only for six months or so. Apple signed a multi-year contract with AT&T, probably so AT&T would carry a phone that broke many industry rules. Apple had complete control over the software on the phone, and it was linked to Apple's music and video stores, not AT&T's. When the App Store came along a year later, that was completely controlled by Apple as well.

The crux of the early festival that continues today is pirates, namely high society members in pirate outfits, capturing the city.
Arkelon Hall passed for 134 yards while completing nine of 14 attempts. He tossed a 14-yard TD strike to Carlos Singleton about midway through the scrimmage.

Nevertheless, jazz and classical musicians still try to work out their differences to this day.

More coverage: The Internet buzzed after Kate Middleton and the fictional Bella Swan (in the "Twilight" movie) wore wedding gowns with long sleeves. Would strapless gowns topple from their perch? Not exactly. "You put a sleeve in the gown and to get a beautiful fit you need a tight armhole, and that really eliminates movement," Durham said. "I've seen brides spin their arms around like a propeller when they're dancing. Sleeves hinder that." Kate's example is being felt, however. Cap sleeves are gaining popularity, as are illusion necklines, as in a strapless dress with a sheer overlay that rises to a boat neck. Longer veils are back, too. More than three in every four women in a David's Bridal survey conducted last fall planned to wear a veil. Many brides are wearing their hair partially down with a veil, as did Middleton, for a modern twist.
Like many people in the procession and at the ceremony, the Krewe members and students took leaves from work and school to celebrate what they feel is a landmark for the area.

Opponents say expanded coverage would lead to more abortions and higher health care costs for all -- claims muddied by the already wide availability of abortion in the state and the fact that abortions cost insurers less than do live births. They also say the measure would violate federal rules barring discrimination against insurers who don't offer abortion coverage for moral reasons, putting at risk $6 billion in federal money.
Hayes, who grew up in a hippie commune, feels natural surrounded by nature. She devotes herself to native plants and romantic, old-time heirloom flowers that had all but disappeared from the commercial market, such as original strains of tall cornflowers, scabiosa, flowering tobacco, dianthus, columbine and agrostemma (corncockles).
After dinner we typically dropped in at the Explorers Lounge to hear the Adagio Strings play and occasionally took in the show in the theater. Every day the program listed 50 things we could see, do, taste or attend, and we skipped most. We were too busy relaxing, though we didn't miss Bill Miller's excellent maritime lectures.
Another bill sponsored by Assemblywoman Shavonda Sumter increases minimum wages for workers who earn tips. They are not covered by current state laws, but federal regs say they must get at least $2.13 per hour base pay, and if tips don’t bring them up to minimum wage, employers must supplement them. Sumter’s bill, which has no Senate counterpart, requires workers who rely on tips to get base pay of at least 40 percent of the prevailing minimum wage, supplemented as needed. Such workers haven’t seen an increase in base pay since 1991, although tips probably rose as the cost of meals and travel went up.
Separately, Van Hollen sued the FEC last April, arguing that the agency crafted regulations that allow groups to avoid disclosing donations used to pay for ads that air shortly before an election and mention a candidate but don't expressly tell voters to vote for or against that person. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia sided with Van Hollen earlier this month. The decision has been appealed.

Back then, the idea was to rein in spending of local governments. It also would have done away with all the wild disparities in property taxes caused by Save Our Homes. Rubio was blocked by Gov. Charlie Crist. One criticism is the now-amusing notion that property taxes are stable.
"The defendant effectively led two different lives," Assistant U.S. Attorney Ethan D.

The Church at Pierce Creek case is not even analogous to the Pulpit Initiative. The Pulpit Initiative is not about churches running full-page political ads in newspapers. Indeed, in that case, the church never asserted that placing the ad was part of its free exercise of religion. In contrast, a pastor speaking from the pulpit to his congregation is the "core" of the free exercise of religion. As you must know, no federal court has ever been confronted with a constitutional challenge to the government's restriction on what a pastor says from the pulpit. The point of the Pulpit Initiative is to create a legal precedent that restores the right of pastors to speak freely from the pulpit without government censorship or control.
The Dodgers carried a 5-4 lead into the ninth and asked right-hander Francisco Felix to close it. Felix, who last year pitched at triple-A Albuquerque (5.99 ERA), gave up a single, hit a batter and then a game-winning two-run double to Brad Davis for a 6-5 loss. That’s Brad Davis the minor league catcher, not the former Mavericks point guard.
Prosecutors said they had no comment because the case is still considered pending.
Beth Kushnik, set decorator on CBS' "The Good Wife," notes that while the main character's world was downsized after a divorce, "she still had a comfortable degree of wealth.

A couple of UCF students — Neal Surrena and Garrett Weiss — had never heard of him either until they saw a segment on ESPN during the weekend telling the story of the many lives he saved on that sad, surreal morning of Sept. 11, 2001. The two students were so inspired, they took to Facebook and Twitter and have apparently persuaded thousands of other UCF students and fans to wear Welles' symbolic red bandanna to Saturday night's game between UCF and Boston College.
Well, being a person of interest in April doesn't mean squat. People talk about grabbing the best player available vs. need. That could be the case with the Chargers, who once could gamble on draft day - when they had more players. But I can't help but doubt the best player available is going to be a guard.

Get the lead out. If you buy anything old and painted, it probably has lead in it. That doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it, but you should take precautions before sanding or scraping paint from cabinets, doors, wood flooring and other items made before 1978, when the federal government banned lead paint in homes. Work on the piece outdoors, keep children out of the area, wear a respirator, gloves and goggles, and clean up with a HEPA vacuum. Too much trouble? Don't buy the piece.
He added that it would take 2½ years to build the pipeline, which so far, he said, Toyota Tsusho, Oil & Natural Gas Corp., China National Petroleum Corp. and Malaysian state-owned oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd. had shown interest in bidding to finance.

One is Spruce, the most talked-about restaurant of the year. I'd go back in a minute, but the food garnered only 2.5 stars; I'm optimistic it will get better. Pescheria is another place that required a lot of deliberation. I love its casual trattoria charm, and a recent return visit showed that it's still very satisfying; ask me tomorrow, and it might make the list. Others, such as Salt House, have improved during the past year, building justifiably loyal followings.
In the play, one of the conspiring reporters works for the Rocky Mountain News, though no evidence exists that the paper played any part in the scheme. But doing so allows Suh to exploit one of the longest newspaper rivalries in history, ending with the News' closure in 2009. You needn't have been alive in 1907 to know how intensely these papers feuded. But that year, Bonfils' enmity for News owner Thomas Patterson spilled out into the streets near the state Capitol. In the spirit of a Wild West duel, Bonfils attacked Patterson, who had called Bonfils a blackmailer in a News cartoon. When the teetering News was bought by Cincinnati media company Scripps-Howard and merged with The Express in 1926, Roy Howard spit, "We believe that a dictatorship of Denver's newspaper field by The Denver Post would be nothing less than a blight."

Lest you assume all visually and acoustically isolating seating to be a product of the iPod age, behold the Canopy Chair. It's a reproduction of a "porter's chair," which hails from the 16th century. Back in the day, the hall porter would hunker down in one of these; the high seat back and sides protected him from front-door drafts, while the hooded headrest helped him stay attuned to distant sounds. Its signature headrest is just as practical today. The "hoodie" is kind of like holding your hands up to your ears: In noisy environments, it makes conversations more intelligible; in quieter places, chatting with someone feels more intimate. If the burlap and exposed brass nailheads of this reproduction aren't your style, there are other equivalents. Jaime Hayon's Showtime Poltrona for BD Barcelona is a sleeker, but no less spectacular version, and it comes in glossy indoor and matte outdoor versions. $1,895, jaysonhome.com

"Most of the time a full-scholarship player is one who can pitch for you on the weekend and hit in the middle of the order right out of the gate," Fox said. "Those are the most talented players that are going to go in the first or second round of the draft. The scholarship amount isn't going to be enough to keep these kids from signing pro contracts."

"I probably would have ended up signing somewhere else," Aldridge said. "Think about it. I was the last option out of those guys, so they both would have gotten max deals, and they wouldn't have given me my deal (five years, $62.5 million). They only signed me because I was the only low post threat left on the team. If they had Greg, they don't give me the number I wanted, and I'm somewhere else. I think about it all the time. I wouldn't even be here had Greg not gotten hurt."

In Carrier's case, Bruininks gave her 13 months of paid leave and a 3.5 percent pay increase. This lifted her annual salary to $212,000 in time for the leave. Should she decide not to return to the faculty after 13 months of transitional leave, the requirement to repay the university for the leave is waived. If she does return to the faculty, Bruininks authorized two months of full-time summer salary to support her research and funds for a half-time research assistant.

The next New York area rapper to make himself a major player: All the buzz surrounded A$AP Rocky, who has been burning up the Internet with a laid-back, menacing delivery that owes as much to Texas hip-hop as it does to rap from his native Harlem. He backed up the hype at the MTV Woodie Awards with a strong performance that featured a guest appearance by Schoolboy Q, another net-rap favorite. But although no real hip-hop fan wants to hear this, Rocky's performance had very little on the the delirious turn by pop-rap combo Chiddy Bang. Newark-raised emcee Chidera "Chiddy" Anamege might swerve around weighty topics, but he's witty even when he's being silly, and his flow is quite a bit tighter than has been reported by hardcore purists. That's especially true in concert. Last spring, he had the kids at Bamboozle going crazy; it's good to see that his magic works in the Lone Star State, too.
Shortly after the 2007 election, Casciano said, his office discovered that a couple of voters appeared to have voted twice, once by absentee and once at the polls.

Top Picks Analysis: A.J. Smith normally isn't gun-shy about moving up in the first round and snaring a player he covets, but the embattled general manager benefited from holding his ground this year. In desperate need of a dangerous pass rusher to give the defense more bite, the Chargers had the good fortune of having one of this year's best in Ingram fall to them at the 18th overall choice. The squatty college lineman can quickly get to the edge with an explosive first step, plus he's stout enough to hold up against the run and displayed excellent lateral agility at the combine that will aid him in coverage. Another possible starter at a thin position was plucked with the second-round selection of Reyes, a powerful and hard-working prospect with the frame to work as a five-technique end in San Diego's 3-4 alignment. Smith's only trade of the draft came in the third round, when he vaulted five spots to claim Taylor, one of the steadying forces on a dominant LSU defense. He's a good tackler with some range and adequate speed, but his best asset may be in the leadership category.

"True Love was great but it got to the point where the only time I was really having fun was when I was doing shows with the Guitar Bar All-Stars or something where I was playing a lot of covers," Hartel adds. "For a while I was doing a Rolling Stones cover band with my wife Tammy Faye Starlight, and then we started doing the Who covers thing. And I was finding a lot more excitement in that because people really listen to it and you can share the enthusiasm they feel for those great old songs. But then Tom starting writing these original Platinum Load songs that had that same feeling, and it felt like we were really saying something that had to be said."

I love, though, that the list includes "Boston," a Madeira from the Rare Wine Co.'s historic series.

Pacifica resident Howard Hall was among those who wrote to tell Fed officials how he had run up $15,000 in card debt after he lost his job in 2001, fell behind in his payments and saw his 8.9 percent rate shoot up to 29 percent - raising his monthly minimum payment to $400.

This month marks the 100th year anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic. To commemorate, the film "Titanic" (released in 1997), has been released in 3-D, IMAX and digital 2D formats in theaters. With this rerelease I have mixed emotions. It's a good idea for the movie to be rereleased in IMAX and digital 2D because many teens my age want to experience the movie in theaters, which is the way many say it should be seen. And huge fans of the Titanic now get the chance to see it clear and in high definition. Also, since the movie is three hours long, I'd like to watch it without being distracted every 30 minutes. I have never watched "Titanic" straight through; I've only watched it in separate segments at different times.

Faced with a lack of energy and inability to put on weight, Moss had sought out Cassileth to get more information about her work and research. Cassileth told her to take the maitake mushroom extract, a dietary supplement.
Gas detectors on board the rig were not set to automatically activate an emergency shutdown system to stop the engines and halt the flow of outside air into engine rooms, and the bridge crew had not been trained on when they should activate the systems. If the shutdown system had been activated as soon as gas was detected, the explosions in the engine room area could have been delayed or avoided, the report said.
American discourse is the freest part of our society. It's what other people dream of as they fight for the democracy we take for granted and sometimes shame. I can't imagine what it's like to live in a country where you cannot say what you want. But just because you can doesn't mean you should.

Some hard-line militants backing al-Qaida — which is made up almost entirely of Islam's majority Sunnis — consider Islam's Shiite branch as heretical and view Iran's regional ambitions as a greater threat than the West. Last year, the al-Qaida faction in Yemen declared "holy war" against Shiite rebels that get apparent indirect support from Tehran.

The group, run by three former Romney aides, also lured Republican mega-donor Harold Simmons, a Dallas-based investor who gave $8.6 million in 2011 to Republican super PACs (including American Crossroads and groups backing Newt Gingrich and former candidate Rick Perry), but nothing last year to the pro-Romney effort. Last month, he gave $100,000 to Restore Our Future, just three days after Romney's strong showing in the New Hampshire primary.
Last week, a House committee endorsed a bill to change that. Its backers say they are hopeful for its passage this year. According to that bill, a TIF commission's rejection could be overridden only by two-thirds of the voters in the taxing districts.
But the exhibits have never been more relevant than today, with the military playing a larger role in the drug war than at any time in its history. Mexican President Felipe Calderon has dispatched 45,000 troops across the country since declaring war on the drug cartels in December 2006.
Egypt's military ruler, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, has hinted in several public comments in recent weeks that the powerful military would not allow the Brotherhood to dominate the country, a response to what is widely seen as the group's hunger for power after 60 years operating illegally and subject to government crackdowns.

Laurinaitis said he got a call from Buckeyes coach Luke Fickell, who asked if Laurinaitis was up for the honor. Among his duties: addressing the team.
And candidates such as Damon will be hurt also by what promises to be a backlog of players on the ballot. At this point, no player associated with performance enhancers, such as Mark McGwire and Rafael Palmeiro, has been elected, nor fallen beneath the 5 percent that would take them off the ballot. I suspect the same will happen to players such as Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens and others. Thus, Damon will have to fight through a congested ballot with, at best, a borderline case.
Despite his recent expressions of faith, the president has had a rocky relationship with Catholic leaders. He has accused priests of siding with the country's wealthy rather than the poor and in a particularly heated clash in 2010, suggested that Christ would whip some church leaders for lying after Cardinal Jorge Urosa warned that democratic freedoms were being eroded in Venezuela.

"Nothing so needs reforming as other people's habits," is the sly Twain quote from "Pudd'nhead Wilson" that opens PBS' "Prohibition," which begins at 8 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 2, on WVIZ Channel 25 and WEAO Channel 49. Burns and Novick then follow this up with another line by Twain: "Fanatics will never learn that, though it be written in letters of gold across the sky. It is the prohibition that makes anything precious."

"We've come to the point where we all realized that the preserve is probably not an appropriate place for a feral cat colony, but we'll work with (Save the Cats) to find them a home somewhere else," Riparian Director Scott Anderson said.
Let me give you an example of a case in which I think the IRS really blew it. We reported a Baptist church in northern Arkansas back in 2004 where the pastor has held a service on Independence Day. Part of the church's service even included registering voters registration (no problem with that). However, the pastor gave a sermon while flanked by two large screens. As he would start talking about an issue, photographs of George W. Bush or Sen. John Kerry would be flashed on the screen. When he said "one candidate" is fighting terrorists, a very nice official White House photo of Bush was shown; he'd then note in a mocking tone that "the other candidate believes we are not at war at all but in a lawsuit." An unflattering picture of Kerry in a crowd was shown. It went on like this for several issues. Bush was praised and Kerry was belittled.

She still wants to remain involved and is considering sharing emceeing duties with Murro in a dual effort to promote her support for the Emmanuel Cancer Foundation, a charity that would have been her platform were she to remain as a contestant, and to repair damaged relationships with contestants sure to be offended by this story, before encountering them again at New Jersey Fashion Week possibly coming to Hoboken later this fall.

The violence also threatened one of Bahrain's key international marketing pushes. Formula 1 organizers said they may pull next month's race in Bahrain, the opening event in the racing circuit's season. Already, the GP2 Asia Series—a race similar to the main GP2 series that serves as a feeder to Formula 1—canceled its second round of races scheduled for this week at the Bahrain International Circuit due to the events there, according to the GP2 website. The site said the Bahrain Motorsport Federation requested the cancellation.

But I went away a little disappointed when no public vote occurred regarding a controversial, six-year-old legal battle by the board against the owner of a wedding venue over the construction of a decorative bridge covering. Now that state courts have roundly rejected the lawsuit, did the board intend to make a federal case out of it? More importantly, who will make the decision? How will the taxpayers/voters know who's responsible for continuing to pay lawyers who have already collected $183,374 to fight a structure that cost $5,000 to build?

David Rubin, an attorney for the administrators association, said that while the ruling was disappointing, it also reaffirmed the association’s contention that schools superintendents are allowed to accrue sick time payouts of exceeding $15,000 if they’re slated to get that under contracts signed before the law took effect. It didn’t address the question of whether automatic renewal of a superintendent is considered a new contract.

With Bannan aboard, the Broncos possess enough defensive tackles to make it through a game, with Mitch Unrein seeing spot duty and defensive end Robert Ayers rotating inside on pass-rush downs when linebacker Von Miller moves to defensive end. The position isn't settled by any means, but it allows the Broncos draft-day flexibility to pick the best player available, not necessarily a defensive tackle if a coveted prospect drops.

Writing for the court, Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor found that "a criminal sentence is final upon the issuance of a final order" and that Ohio lawmakers tied the hands of judges when they passed the so-called truth-in-sentencing law in 1996, which repealed the section of law that had allowed the leeway to modify sentences.

Of course, there are many, many more and bigger things to be thankful for. So as long as we're on the subject, where should we start? Somebody once told me that a happy life includes "The three Fs" - family, friends and faith - and those are biggies, but I'd also add fun and food. Staying with the alliterative motif, maybe it's fried food or fast food.

Will Lee-Williams (Philly) sports nerdy, thick glasses and rolls through hits like "I'm Your Puppet" and "Me and Mrs. Jones." Alexander Elisa's Memphis is the least sophisticated of the trio but also the most sweet-natured. His gentle disposition gives extra heft to his renditions of "Hold On, I'm Coming" and "Tobacco Road." The most cocksure of the bunch is Detroit (Tyrick Wiltez Jones), who is sure that he has the competition won. After all, as he tells us, he has two distinct musical influences: He was born in the Motor City, but raised in Chicago. This double pedigree means he performs plenty of Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke and rolls through especially soulful renditions of "Lonely Teardrops," "Chain Gang" and "Wonderful World." Oddly missing, though, are the Motown classics you might expect to hear from an aspiring star with roots in the city that launched the careers of Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.
"It's another step forward," says Anne Balcer Norton, deputy commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation.

How many police bullets actually hit Kendrec McDade, 19 years old and unarmed, on that dark Pasadena street? Do police have to yell "halt" or "stop" before pulling the trigger?

Since 1927, Grauman's Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard has been one of Southern California's most recognizable and visited landmarks. Home to movie premieres and three Academy Awards ceremonies, the exterior was designed to resemble a red Chinese pagoda. Exterior architecture includes a large dragon and two authentic Chinese Ming Heaven dogs guarding the entrance, while the interior décor is supported by a large number of Asian gongs, statues, vases, friezes and shields. Touch one of the wax figures in traditional Cathay Chinese costumes found in the lobby for good luck, as moviemakers used to do before embarking on a new film project.

Sitcom's locally designed furniture collections will seem familiar to anyone who's spent time shopping for modern furniture styles. Furniture and accessories sold at the outlet are often marked as one-of-a-kind floor models, or they may be discontinued collections or pieces. Cabinetry, tables, media centers and bookcases are often sold in boxes for assembly. At its upcoming sale, overstock, discontinued and slightly damaged designer furniture and accessories will be marked down further. In the same warehouse, Hebi Arts, wholesaler of innovative, contemporary home accessories will be selling discontinued and sample inventory at 50 to 70 percent markdowns from retail.
Democrats at the Capitol say cuts since January total $15 billion, while Republicans say they believe spending reductions are actually around $7 billion. By either measure, California will look different.
Yes, quarterback Tim Tebow has to improve. But the Denver defense also has to get better. And if the Broncos lose Dennis Allen to a head coaching job — he's a candidate in Oakland — they will be looking to hire their seventh defensive coordinator in seven years. The Broncos won't become a heavyweight on the defensive side of the ball until they have continuity there, in system and personnel.

When we attended the annual Feast of Lanterns Festival in Pacific Grove, I did not imagine that 65 years ago squid boats lit at night were used to attract the mollusks, a harvest no one desired until the Chinese created a market for them. After 1906, the year someone set fire to the Point Alones Chinatown, where the Monterey Bay Aquarium now stands, Pacific Grove residents grew nostalgic for the lights, like fairy lanterns on the water, and so a magic tale was born to glimmer.

Bob Davis of sponsor Soul Patrol, an internet radio station, implored audience members and performers alike to get health and life insurance. Emcee Darrell McNeill tried to dispel the misconception that P-Funk’s hits made the band members rich. The popular “Glee,” he reminded us, recently featured a “watered-down, milquetoast” version of “Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker).” Parliament, reported McNeill, didn’t receive a dime.
"I am impressed with her business background and I am thrilled that there is a qualified woman running for this congressional seat," said Brunner, who lost the 2010 Democratic U.S. Senate primary to Lee Fisher.
"We played well for the most part all day long," he said. "It's a shame we didn't play as well in the finals as we did earlier on. But Vianney's a good team. They're well coached."
The voters have spoken on the Howard County Board of Education, though what they said is perhaps open to interpretation. One newcomer who promises to shake things up won big, as did a couple of other newcomers who also ran as outsiders. But two incumbents who are both part of the establishment also won big, while the third incumbent, the ultimate outsider, lost. And then there's the unpleasant reality that so few of the voters bothered to make their voices heard at all, a weak turnout that was not unexpected but which makes reading too much into the results risky.
Dr. Timothy Pittinger, director of the burn center at Akron Children's Hospital, expects the next five years to bring more dramatic change, maybe the biggest in a long time.
If you add the final two games of the playoffs last season, the Predators have won the last six games against the Ducks. Which leads to the question: Are they in the head of the Ducks?

At first, Cain and his backers could blame press scrutiny with ease. The early stories from Politico and other news organizations, including The Associated Press, did not include the names of Cain's accusers or many specific details of what he was alleged to have done.
"By doing that it would hopefully draw some people who either want to switch, move, or come downtown," Mihelich said Friday. "The idea is to lure people in with very attractive rental rates and then (Triple) will spend some money to dial up the suites."

John Steinbeck has reason to smile, with classic film adaptations of "The Grapes of Wrath," "Of Mice and Men" and "East of Eden." The same could be said of Jane Austen and Dashiell Hammett. And the hit-and-miss Shakespeare lineup at least has its share of direct hits.

Will it be the Ducks squad that shot a scintillating 69 percent on the road against Washington State, cruising to a 92-75 win? How about the group that followed the lead of Devoe Joseph, who scored a career-high 30 points on Jan. 5 as Oregon pulled off a 78-67 win over Stanford? Or will it be the team that fell apart defensively against Cal, letting the Bears run away with a 77-60 win last Sunday?

More important, Congress has already cut $5 billion from this fund to help pay for this year's extension of unemployment benefits, reduced payroll taxes and higher fees for Medicare doctors -- with broad support from Democrats. And Obama's budget proposal this year proposed cutting $4 billion more from the fund by prioritizing investments. So even proponents of the healthcare reform law don't consider the fund sacrosanct.
A: When an airline changes its schedule, you're entitled to either a refund or a flight of its choosing, under its contract. But when you've bought a package vacation, it's not that simple. There are hotel rooms and activities to take into consideration. Apple's $50 offer was reasonable but too restrictive, because it required you to buy another trip.
"I don't know if culture shock is the right word, but that's a major philosophical change that these kids need to understand and get used to," Herman said.

But hold the phone, friends. By suggesting this, I may be taking a walk on the riled side. An avid hiker tells me that some poles have gone uptown and that some hikers have quite an investment in them. "There has been an explosion of upscale hiking poles ($100 and up) that collapse, are made of titanium, have external or internal fittings, etc.," said Mary Forgione, an avid outdoorswoman who worked on the staff of the Times Outdoors section and now is the daily Travel and Deals blogger for latimes.com/traveldeals. "Gone are the carefully culled tree limbs of yore you would find along the trail…I favor Leki and Black Diamond with external fittings."

It's possible few players helped themselves more at the NFL combine than Irvin, who turned heads with his blazing 40-yard dash time of 4.50 seconds - easily the fastest of any player listed as a defensive end. Irvin's future could lie as a pass-rushing end in a 4-3 defense, although he may profile better as an outside linebacker in a 3-4 set. Either way, quarterbacks will want to keep an eye on him after he racked up 22 1/2 sacks in 26 career games at West Virginia, finally coming into his own after some rocky times during his teenage years. Irvin never finished high school and even spent some time in a juvenile detention center before earning his GED and attending junior college, then making the most of his opportunity in Morgantown. If NFL teams are convinced his off-the-field problems are in the past, Irvin's impressive rise could result in a first-round selection, although he's not without some football-related doubts.

Charities, scammers and relatives who feel entitled to the money are among those who could approach the winners with their hands out, Lowell Herman, chair of the trusts and estates group at the Baltimore-based Gordon Feinblatt law firm, warned.

Molina has had plenty of opportunities to deal with other people's opinions of her. In 1976, in the wake of Argentina's military coup, she moved with her family to Paris. Molina was 12 years old. "I remember my sister and I, our only concern was to try to fit — to fit in there, and not be just foreigners, not to have an accent in school, not to be the different ones," she recalls. "At that age, you don't want to be the different one. We succeeded in that because after a year we were just one of them. They sometimes thought we weren't from Paris but they never thought we weren't French.

Yes, lawyers are behind a lot of this. Excessive tests are often ordered because doctors are understandably so afraid of lawsuits. But tests and treatment can have risks, too. For instance, a CT scan is routinely done for head bumps, even when no internal injury is suspected, "just to be sure" things are fine. Such scans, judiciously used, can be lifesaving. But they deliver radiation hundreds of times or more than that of a dental X-ray. And a study just out in the journal Cancer says that overexposure to even dental scans may be linked to a certain brain cancer.
In addition, plants in Sterling Heights and Saltillo, Mexico, will observe the summer shutdown only for one week, the company said.
A lamb chop and medallion followed, but the green garlic sformato, only about the size of a half dollar, drew my attention; it was one of those revelations I call a Chez Panisse moment, where you think, "This is what green garlic should taste like."

"Without a doubt (fumbling troubles) is what I would say," Ridley said today. Patriots coach Bill Belichick "didn't have to say it.

Such attacks have raised doubts about the readiness of the Afghan government to take control of security as international forces draw down over the next two years. Afghanistan's international allies have stressed that they do not plan to abandon the country in 2014 and will provide the support needed to help Afghanistan protect its people. Most recently, the U.S. and Afghan governments agreed on a deal earlier this week for a U.S. presence in the country through 2024.
"We'll keep moving forward," Dayton said after the meeting. But, he said, the responsibility would now fall to Republican leaders to put together a plan that could win legislative approval. Dayton had planned to release his own proposal on Monday. "It's counterproductive for me to come out ahead with something, because it seems to have the opposite effect," Dayton said.

The growth of health costs slowed in the 1990s as health maintenance organizations became more popular. That played a role in both gains in household income -- less money on employer-provided health benefits means more money for raises -- and in budget surpluses, economists argue.
Today's declarer won the second heart, took the top diamonds and ruffed his last diamond in dummy. East overruffed with the queen -- a major faux pas. South ruffed the heart return, took the ace of trumps, returned a club to his ace and led the jack of trumps. East won, but South later drew East's eight with his ten and took the rest.

Governor O'Malley's action clears his desk of parole and commutation recommendations for the first time since he took office, but it hardly reflects a great thawing in his stance on intervening in the cases of those serving life sentences. Since the General Assembly began debate last year on a law requiring the governor to act on parole recommendations within 180 days or have the commission's recommendations go into effect automatically, Mr. O'Malley has rendered decisions in 59 cases. In 57 of them, the recommendations were denied.

When the last marker was installed 10 years ago this summer, Kanahele's desire might have been seen as well-meant yet rather optimistic.

For our global celebration of spring, we couldn't help but think pink and pastel. And to really set the tone for a proper Mar-Tea-Ni party masses of carnations became a nod to English topiary. Pink table runners that you can make yourself served as decor and place mats, too. To do this at home, simply cut fabric to your desired length, allowing for a 1-inch border on each side. Tuck an inch of the fabric under on each side, and iron it to make a crisp fold. Then iron again with Stitch Witchery, which fuses the fabric together and creates a no-sew seam.

The unfortunate part of the whole story is that it takes away from what O'Leary accomplished on the field. He had nine catches for 152 yards and a touchdown. This kid — dare I say kid, since he's a full-fledged, adult-sized6-foot-4, 211-pound man among boys — is the most talented tight end I have ever seen at the prep level. Before that for me it was the former Michigan Wolverine, Pittsburgh Steeler TE Jerame Tuman out of little Liberal, Kan. Tuman could catch the ball as well as any tight end, but he was more of an extension of the offensive line.
Wal-Mart, the giant retailer under fire over allegations of foreign bribery in Mexico, has participated in an aggressive and high-priced lobbying campaign to amend the long-standing U.S. anti-bribery law that the company might have violated.
Moraga's decadence and Lee's rage clash in the climactic sword fight, performed without props and with gripping passion. But those senior artists were outshone by Rachna Nivas as the queen. Charismatic, and resplendent in purple velvet and jewels, she poured emotion from every economical, natural gesture. And at the end, when she wailed over the lifeless body of her husband, Nivas channeled the sorrow of a lost nation.
Firefighters, who have approved a no-confidence vote in their chief, may take a similar vote on Leopold if they win at arbitration and Leopold doesn't propose funding it, Oldershaw said. Three police unions have voted no confidence in their chief and Leopold.

A second boat crash occurred in Ocean County just before 8 p.m., when a boat collided with a kayak in Gunner’s Ditch in Brick Township, just north of the Mantoloking Bridge, authorities said. The crash knocked the paddler of the kayak out of his vessel and into the water, according to State Police spokesman Brian Polite, but the boat’s operator managed to pull the man to safety.
Among my favorite lines from the speech had to be the following statement for its food-for-thought factor:
Craft brands are slowly gaining space on store shelves and restaurant menus, Gatza said. One reason is that some drinkers are switching from wine to beer. Also, locally-made products - including beer - are hot. And perhaps most importantly, support from wholesalers and retailers is growing, thanks to the hefty profits that stores and distributors can earn from, say, a $9 six-pack of craft beer.
A recent poll in Alameda County, for example, showed that 100 percent of Republicans surveyed said they "definitely" planned to vote - compared with 80 percent of Democrats.

Qantas spokesman Tom Woodward said the airline's checks were already complying with the new EASA order, and there had been no new discoveries of any problems. Still, engineers were conducting further tests on the three engines where oil was found, and none of the A380 fleet would return to the air for the time being, he said.
Floaters are a natural product of the aging process. They're produced when the vitreous humor – the transparent gel that fills about 80 percent of the eyeball and helps maintain its round shape – changes consistency over time, partially liquefying and shrinking, which causes it to pull away from the interior surface of the eyeball. When this happens, clumps of cells, pigment or stringy vitreous can break loose and begin wandering aimlessly within the eyeball.

For older clients, the experience can be physically and emotionally taxing, said Mahla, who began as a home-office organizer 15 years ago. She tries to key into the bigger concerns from the get-go. Some worry about transporting a pet on moving day or shipping an heirloom desk out of state. One of her first clients, recently widowed, was stressed about television and cable service in the new place.
Holtz, who cut her visit short after just 25 hours, said her experience makes her wonder how many vulnerable adults have suffered without telling anyone. She said the worst part occurred when a nurse began a routine skin check that seemed more like a strip search.
Some of the harshest criticism came from abroad. Officials in China, Brazil and Russia complained that by devaluing the dollar, the Fed's efforts gave U.S. exports an unfair advantage. A lower dollar makes U.S. goods cheaper overseas and foreign goods more expensive in the United States.
Cervenik said Melissa Fortunato, an FBI special agent, met with him at Euclid City Hall in June or July and played a recording of Cervenik's 70-second conversation with Dimora.
Levinson quickly sets about kicking through all the emotional debris of a house divided by its pain and its past. Lynn's ex, Paul (Thomas Hayden Church), got custody of Dylan years ago in their bad breakup and raised him with his brassy, bitter new wife (Demi Moore, nearly spitting nails with every word she directs at Lynn). She took their troubled daughter Alice (Kate Bosworth), who cuts rather than cries and has built a new life that includes an overly steady (sedated?) husband, played by a glassy-eyed Jeffrey DeMunn, and two sons.
It's "back on the table," says Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group.

They can follow a scavenger hunt to discover what fruits and vegetables look like just as the season is in its first blush of summer, help transplant sunflowers which visitors can watch grow to a towering 10 feet during the summer, discover a wetland that runs through the mini-farm, meet the farm animals, and try tasty treats straight from the farm at the farm stand. Competitive spirits can enter the strawberry pie contest or try their hand at a plant identification contest. This is a great way to meet your local farmer and enjoy a day on the farm with the whole family.
The Missouri Department of Transportation is trying to resurrect a derailed plan to build two-lane ramps tying the Poplar Street Bridge to I-55. The current one-lane ramps are notorious for traffic backups.

It reminded Emily, an artist, of the Catalina Mountain views from her childhood home in Tucson.
Pasta, however, is hit-and-miss. In the bad old days, it was routinely cooked to mush. Nowadays, the problem is often undercooking. That happened to both the spaghetti ($16) with squash and tomato sauce (which desperately needed a hit of cheese), as well as the corzetti ($15), coinlike disks draped in a salty beef ragu. In contrast, the gnocchi ($15), kicked up with pancetta and broccoli rabe, were just right.
But the proximity of Kindermann Forest Camp doesn't necessarily make the setting seem any less exotic, given what goes on there.
This carry-out and delivery pizzeria brags that it offers the most-healthful pizza around.
The Bears' primary needs are obvious enough. They need the most help on the offensive line and at defensive tackle. If one of the following players falls to them at No. 29, though, it might tempt them go in a different direction. If nothing else, the availability of any of the following players would make the Bears' 10 minutes on the clock more interesting.

But hey, that's just my opinion.
The equipment to be secured would include ships working to process oil being sucked to the surface from a containment device and the rigs drilling the two relief wells. The way the system is set up now, oil would flow unabated into the Gulf if BP had to abandon its containment effort because of a storm.
One new feature this year is an indicator of the event's growing popularity: shuttle buses will run from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. from parking lots at St. Charles Community College to the parade area.

Time Warner's cable TV networks, which include CNN, TBS, TNT and HBO, saw revenue grow 3 percent to $3.6 billion.

A few decks below, 28-degree seawater poured into forward holds. Alarmed engineers shut electric-operated doors to seal the ship's 16 watertight compartments - a ballyhooed safety feature and a big part of the myth of unsinkability.

Homer Williams and the city drew plenty of heat for how they executed the South Waterfront development. A tram linking the new district to OHSU's main campus went far over budget.

Asked if he'd look at it afterward, Babcock said, "No, not yet," adding that he didn't specifically so he wouldn't be able to comment on it.
The former Charleston, S.C., black chief of police, Reuben Greenberg, said the problem facing black America is not racial profiling. He said, "The greatest problem in the black community is the tolerance for high levels of criminality." Former Los Angeles black police Chief Bernard Parks, defending racial profiling, said: "It's not the fault of the police when they stop minority males or put them in jail. It's the fault of the minority males for committing the crime. In my mind, it is not a great revelation that if officers are looking for criminal activity, they're going to look at the kind of people who are listed on crime reports." Are former police Chiefs Greenberg and Parks racist?
It could also be because of the next generation of toxic chemicals -- kestrels eat a lot of mice and insects, so they're vulnerable to insecticides and rodenticides.

"It's really a lot easier to play defense when the offense is really clicking like that,'' Wynn said. "Our job is to give the ball back to the offense, and it's really nice to give the ball back to the offense and we only have one punt (with a minute left in the fourth quarter).''

WASHINGTON -- It's understandable if unfortunate that the controversy surrounding the killing of Trayvon Martin has polarized the country along both racial and ideological lines. But there is one issue that should not have any racial connotations: the urgency of repealing stand-your-ground laws.
Economic drivers: Arizona grows up, as the state adds 1 million residents, 430,000 jobs and nearly 30,000 businesses during the decade. But a 1988 article in Barron's, critical of the Valley's real-estate growth, weak financial institutions and lack of coordinated economic development, ruffles feathers and hurts local pride. The Valley grows its high-tech footing led by companies such as Intel, Motorola, Honeywell and Allied-Signal, while McDonnell Douglas Helicopter establishes its Apache plant and testing center in Mesa.

Probably because it dealt with an innocent -- a girl who was 7 when she disappeared and is still childlike and unformed when she's discovered, 9 years later -- "Let Your Hair Down" was a less sure-footed blend. How irreverent can you be when dealing with a missing child (never mind the undercooked Rapunzel long-hair angle)? On the one hand, Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) was as bracingly amusing as ever. On the other, he was serving as a sort of father figure for the girl, which made his wisecracks about her feel a little off-kilter.

The largest driver for the May rate increase has been Xcel's decision to terminate its wholesale contract with Black Hills Energy, which serves Pueblo and the Arkansas River Valley. Xcel's request to have retail ratepayers make up for the lost revenue was strongly opposed by many experts testifying on Xcel's current rate increase. These experts pointed out that business decisions made on Xcel's wholesale side should not add to the financial burden of Xcel's retail customers who bore no responsibility for Xcel's decision.

In 1983, Barack Obama published an article in the Sundial at Columbia University decrying the "relentless, often silent spread of militarism in the country."

That shadow is Gainsbourg's Jewish identity personified. We meet Lucien "Serge" Gainsbourg (played as an adult by Eric Elmosnino) during World War II, when French collaborators help the Nazis round up and deport Jews. But the boy embraces his Jewishness, as represented by a pair of big-nosed costumed characters that follow him from art school (where he shamelessly flirts with an older nude model) to the swingin' '60s nightclub scene (where he writes lascivious songs for young pop starlets).

The molecular mechanisms that have made for such promising drug targets can also lead the tumors to develop resistance to the new treatments. As a result, companies are researching the combination of therapies, including vemurafenib and Yervoy.
Families earning more than $250,000 and individuals making more than $200,000 will not only pay new health care-related taxes, but also face the likely expiration of upper-income tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush. As a result, these Americans could be tapped for about $650 billion in additional taxes over the next 10 years — a prospect that is loaded with both political opportunity and peril.
As mayor, Alioto-Pier said she would focus on job creation through expanding the programs she initiated as supervisor to give payroll tax breaks to biotech companies and rebates to production companies that film in the city. She said she would push to get rid of the payroll tax altogether, expand the cruise ship industry, and advocate for a school assignment system based almost entirely on neighborhood schools.
"I told Greg when he got here that I would be involved in his life from the beginning," Holmgren said Sunday. "We had a little chat. It was nice."
The report, circulated last week by the group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, said there was "inadequate enforcement staffing" in 2008 and 2009 by state health officials at shellfish processing plants. Those officials are charged with making the plants meet temperature-control requirements to guard against "Vibrio parahaemolyticus," a bacterium that causes serious illnesses in humans. The FDA also said that last year, the DEP did not fully patrol 21 of 30 polluted coastal areas designated for monitoring to avoid poachers harvesting and selling contaminated mollusks.

Take the proposed nanny-state farm-worker regulation withdrawn (but not killed) by the Labor Department last month. It would have prohibited workers 16 or under from using powered equipment (which would seem to cover even battery-powered screwdrivers) unless working on a parent’s farm. Isn’t that the rule today? No. The proposal would have required the farm to be “wholly owned” by parents, thus letting the rule apply to the many farms owned in partnership with brothers, sisters or other relatives.
CPAP machines have clunky masks, they're a hassle to travel with and as romantic as a cold sore.
Congratulations to the students and supporters who have made a difference in our world.
Mortensen discussed the main players involved in trading up to get the No. 2 pick and select Baylor's Robert Griffin III. He hints there might be a couple of surprises, in terms of teams offering to get the No. 2 pick from the St. Louis Rams.

Financially, both sides have lost hundreds of millions because of the games missed and the countless more that will be wiped out before play resumes. Team employees are losing money, and in some cases, jobs. And both the NBA and NBPA eventually must regain the loyalty of an angered fan base that wonders how the league reached this low point after such a strong 2010-11 season.
Let's break it down:
Finally, there is the marketable product -- white pelletized fertilizer now being sold under the brand name Crystal Green to local nurseries and turf farms in the Portland area, as well as to fertilizer distributors across North America and Europe.
Rep. Wally Hicks, R-Grants Pass, opposed the bill for similar reasons, noting that the share of adults with college degrees is declining with each generation in Oregon.

He was the hero/culprit, depending on your outlook and loyalties. As bizarre as it sounds, his worse sin wasn't his overtime fumble as the Bears were driving for what would have been the winning points.
Herrera cited a report issued last month by an expert panel convened by the Public Utilities Commission to bolster his case. It found that for years before the San Bruno blast, an understaffed commission relied on a policy of "voluntary compliance" that allowed PG&E to largely self-audit and self-report violations, without the fear of fines.
What does El Paso have to do with a tiny country that borders India, Nepal and Tibet? The reason for this unusual connection has to do with two people who never met.

"There is no question that she is a liberal, but she is more thoughtful and less off the wall," says Schramm, who cites the lawsuit Kucinich filed over dental damage from biting into an olive pit among Kucinich's "off the wall" actions.

Since this is an apple farm, we couldn't pass up the fresh apple pie for dessert. It was one of the best pies I've ever had -- a huge, hot wedge-shaped slice oozing sweet-tart apples under a delectable caramel-crumb crust, paired with melting cinnamon ice cream ($4.45).
In an April 10 court declaration, Wong said Gantes' failure to pay "has been devastating."
Of those 71 walks, 21 of them are intentional. La Russa explained that by doubling up on leadoff hitters in addition to backing Pujols with Ryan Ludwick on Wednesday he was banking on keeping Pujols' bat in play by putting runners on. Hard to miss a .366 average against. But there are times -- like when he's leading off this inning here -- that the Pirates continue to pitch to him. Kudos for ... temerity. Pujols' average against the Pirates is his highest against any National League team, and his total bases against the Pirates are the most he has against any National League team.
No, wait: Infuriating. That's what I mean.
David Auburn has written a pretty good play about an immensely promising subject. It's the gap between expectation and result that makes "The Columnist" a disappointment, though there's nothing at all disappointing about the Manhattan Theatre Club's production, cleanly and clearly staged by Daniel Sullivan, or John Lithgow's elegantly flamboyant performance as Joseph Alsop, the once-celebrated newspaper columnist who coined the phrase "domino theory." A blue-blooded WASP who supported the Vietnam War long after most of his fellow journalists jumped ship, Alsop got into boiling-hot water when the KGB found out in 1957 that he was also a closeted homosexual and attempted to blackmail him. "The Columnist" revolves around these two facts, but Mr. Auburn devotes far more time and energy to the first one, and my guess is that by intermission you'll be thinking that he should have written his play the other way around.

"You aren't my best friend anymore!" he said as he bent down, "picked" up the "ball" and "threw" it to his brother before stomping off into the car.

My wife and I got all the kids into the car and stopped before getting in to look at one another.
Background: Originally released in 1971, the "Electric Warrior" album featured signature T. Rex songs "Bang a Gong (Get It On)" and "Jeepster." The cover art depicted T. Rex frontman Marc Bolan (1947-1977) playing guitar in front of a monolithic amplifier stack. "Electric Warrior" was an 11-song release, so to make the math work for six 7-inch records, this Record Store Day reissue adds a B-side titled "Raw Ramp." The six sleeves can be assembled to make a larger image of Bolan.

Well, Craig had two stints on the DL last year (two weeks in April, two months following a June 7 game in Houston) and still managed 200 at-bats. Between 300-400 at-bats for this season sure seems possible if he's healthy as early as Mozeliak suggested.

It's not clear that Israel is convinced, but President Obama deserves credit for his forceful argument that the Jewish state shouldn't precipitously attack Iran's nuclear program. He has also effectively rebuked American politicians, including his Republican rivals, for "beating the drums of war." At the same time, Obama has committed the United States to a "military effort" to block a nuclear weapon — a newly muscular formulation of his long-standing commitment to take no option off the table.

Time management tip: You just have to get it done when you find the time. There's a lot of time people don't recognize.

But Winograde isn't doing documentary work here. In photos with titles like "Battle on the Little Bighorn" and "Wagon Train," the shooter pulls way back, framing long horizontal scenes (as wide-screen as 18 inches by 48 inches) that are as much sky as they are land. A viewer can't make out a face, or even the what is going on exactly. The stories become murky, the truth muddled. They don't draw conclusions, but an artist can go a long way by simply raising a few questions about what really happened.

A day after the Los Angeles Angels acquired superstar Albert Pujols in December, a trickle of fans found their way to the team's Arizona spring training site in Tempe Diablo Stadium.

Thick smoky grilled Japanese eggplant dotted with a confetti of shrimp, scallion, sweet pepper and lime sauce is like the satisfying spicy-sweet vegetarian answer to a carnivore's ruddy steak. Unfortunately, some of the eggplant is raw in the middle.
A formidable presence, with close-cropped red hair and a gaze as searing as her comic timing is sharp, Pittman cleverly undercuts her forcefulness with quips about her weight, driving and the etiquette of flipping off other drivers. Her rapid-patter, seemingly digressive opening gambit also serves to introduce both story and theme - rage, in every sense of the word. Her road rage intersects with her World War II veteran father's hair-trigger temper, and, a bit more tentatively than she seems to intend, with a society affected by post-combat and other violence.

Viso: I think it's a huge advantage working in contemporary art. When you're working with artists you often get tougher, more experimental work; it's more raw. When they're presenting in New York they edit themselves more. I think we all are much more adventurous. That's true in performance and exhibitions. Artists take more risks here because they can. They might try things out here before they take them elsewhere. So for us it's an advantage, though it might appear at first as a disadvantage.

For most movie fans, a Spielberg film is technically flawless, with a great deal of heart thrown in for good measure. Too much heart, some would say, because they think Spielberg's movies occasionally slip from moving to schlocky, with the director manipulating emotions, going so far overboard to make his work resonate with family-friendly messages that he dilutes the material. Others think he is a master at providing audiences with unforgettable images and stories, combining the two in stirring fashion.

Today we are construing statutory text where the precise choice of words does have a dispositive effect on the analysis.

øIn both cases, the warnings were harbingers of touchdowns. But three out of every four times the National Weather Service issues a formal tornado warning, there isn't one.

The initiative is clearly modeled on Proposition 71, which eight years ago moved the state into the medical research business in a big way by creating a stem-cell agency with $3 billion in bond funding. This page endorsed that initiative. But at the time, underPresidentGeorge W. Bush, the federal government was shirking its responsibility to properly fund embryonic stem-cell research and was tying the hands of researchers by limiting them to existing, less useful stem-cell lines. In addition, Proposition 71 provided a defined amount of money for research — Proposition 29 would spend far more over the years — and created a structure under which the state and its taxpayers could share in royalties and licenses from new discoveries. It remains to be seen whether the state will reap that supposed bounty, but at least it made sense to hope that California might become a national center for embryonic stem-cell research.

"They have had success coming into states and building those relationships, and that's what they're looking to do here," said Greg Peden, a Portland lobbyist hired by Centene. "I think they are very serious and would like to make this work."

SUCCESS SOUNDS LIKE ... A COWBELL?
There are two ways a horror film can go with its scares. It can be gruesome and graphic (like the original “The Exorcist”). It can refuse to show you anything, and make you imagine much worse (like the smart “Paranormal Activity”).
One of the most painful parts of the testing mania is that schools are forced to narrow their curriculums to maximize test prep and increase instruction time around math and English. For the past four years, our kids' schools have cut enrichment programming to clear the way. The same is true at many schools across the city.
Here's how it all unfolded:
It says the two remained close until Karl's death in 1971 and shared holidays, birthdays and vacations. The elder Baron left him keepsakes and World War II mementos, the family sword, a signet ring and paintings by Dutch masters.
Baylor's Robert Griffin III, the 2011 Heisman Trophy winner, is projected to be the No. 2 pick in the April 26-28 draft. Griffin has a better arm than Tebow and better speed. But as Tebow has shown, college production has nothing to do with NFL production. Tebow was one of the greatest players in college football history.
"Tonight I just wanted to make sure that I blocked every shot that came my way."
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, in going further than any previous commissioner, sent a clear message to professional football: The league is getting more violent and bounties won't be tolerated.
The center offers breakfast and lunch four days a week at Ainsworth United Church of Christ in Northeast Portland. It also provides counseling, computers and hot showers. Demand for its services, Berman says, is rising.
On its face, justice in the case of a child with an STD might seem easy. The doctor who discovers such an infection is required to report it. The culprit will surely be whoever had both access to the child and the same disease.
Business software maker Lawson fared better with sales up 4 percent, profits up 17 percent and market value up 63 percent. A suitor's unsolicited offer for Lawson has driven up the stock price this year.

An investigative panel has recommended that 109 principals, assistant principals, school-based testing coordinators and teachers face further scrutiny or sanctions after it found evidence of suspected cheating at 58 Atlanta Public Schools.
A: I do think that the nature of the way we are has allowed us to stick around as long as we have, because we have that sort of flexibility that's ever-evolving and changing in whatever way I'm guiding it. I have friends that have been in bands a long time — at least as long as us — and they're much more defined as an entity. But as a creation, we're a collective of people going out and making music on our own terms.

"A computer never replaces a teacher," CPS chief Ron Huberman said. "(But) it allows the most talented and gifted students to move extra fast and the students struggling to take the time they need to before moving on to the next task."
The commercial harvest of mature almonds, in late summer, is highly mechanized, but the collection of green almonds is utterly low-tech. On a gorgeous mild morning last week, in this small town 25 miles northwest of Bakersfield, Nate Siemens of Fat Uncle Farms walked through a lush 18-acre almond orchard and simply plucked off the low-hanging fruits into brown paper bags.
"Sending a signal that bringing or sending children to the U.S. illegally will result in full or partial legal status for them will only encourage more people to violate the law," Mehlman said.

Mettille said outreach to other younger widows is tough since "women are spread out across Minnesota." And the local chapter has been slower to adapt to social media sites, such as Facebook or Yahoo groups, than the national organization, she said.
"It's not always physical, it's ­mental," Chatman said. "I'm sick of hearing myself say the same words over and over. We're going to figure it out or we're going to keep coming up short."
CLASS 1A SATURDAY'S QUARTERFINALS
"To come back from being down 1-0 to beat Edwardsville is huge," said Rivenburgh, a 6-foot-1, 165-pound senior forward. "I think we're the best team in the MVCHA, and we showed it the past two games."
Although blanc de noirs are considered dry, they are not bone dry and can be fruity. They also have substantial body. I decided to try two in the under-$15 range, and I made sure they were made in a similar fashion to Champagne using a process known as the méthode champenoise. Those wines go through a second fermentation in their own bottles, which can produce better-tasting wines with longer-lasting, small bubbles.
Shares of the German company, which has its U.S. headquarters in Portland, jumped to a record high on the news, as investors brushed aside its warning that "commercial irregularities" at its Reebok unit in India could cost it nearly 200 million euros ($265 million). In an unscheduled announcement to update investors on its new expectations as well as the problems in India, Adidas said sales in China soared 26 percent on a currency-neutral basis in the first quarter, helping it to top sales and profit forecasts.
The memo, addressed to "all teachers and faculty," states that "2012 school year brings the requirement of bi-annual drug tests of all Teachers and School Workers," and says the requirement comes from a provision of the "Federal Act for Families, section 7730.HO."
The 2004 season is best described as beauty, catharsis, sunshine, and heartbreak amongst chaos and uncertainty. I was living in Boise, just divorced; the team was taken over by the PCL and was selling Section 107 season tickets to justify the team's existence. All that happened that year was the Gordon Chainsaw Massacre, an epic Vancouver/Seattle road trip, the rise of Scot Thompson, the evolution of 107 into an Army and a family, and the Sunshine Goal (described further down) for the Commissioner's Cup.
Oregon State eulogized Fred Thompson Thursday afternoon during a Celebration of Life ceremony at the LaSells Stewart Center on campus.
A member of the school's athletic department told me Pat was steadfastly determined to come to Denver for The Final Four. On Saturday, Summitt showed up at the arena during — oddly enough — the workout of longtime archrival UConn — and talked with coach Geno Auriemma. Courtside, she signed autographs and accepted well-wishes from the crowd that surrounded her. Nobody is certain if this will be her last trip to the Final Four. She can coach at Tennessee as long as she wants, but how long will she want to?
Each injectable drug was used by doctors for years before getting official approval as a wrinkle-releaser. In the 1990s Hollywood stars already were having Botox injected a few days before an appearance at, say, the Academy Awards.

First, defensive end Justin Tuck applied the pressure, bullying Wayne Hunter into Mark Sanchez, and forcing the quarterback to hold the ball longer than he wanted. He tried to scramble, but defensive tackle Chris Canty got to him in the end zone and the referees ruled forward progress had stopped there. A sack and safety. Just like that, the game was all but over.
The "prudent and appropriate - although not necessarily legally mandated - course of action" was for the mayor to fully disclose any involvement with Westplex and "recuse himself" from discussions relating to it, the report states. "Going forward, it is recommended that whenever a board member or the mayor has any personal interest in a transaction or issue pending before them, the safest and best course of action, at a minimum, is to disclose that interest."

Nor do I. Did Smith do the right thing in not paying Jackson all that money and allowing him to leave? If it would have meant closing up free agent shop, yes. He got Robert Meachem and Eddie Royal to go along with Malcom Floyd, Gates and Vincent Brown. He brought back Randy McMichael and signed free agent Dante Rosario to brace Antonio Gates at tight end. He signed fullback/tailback Le'Ron McClain to complement Ryan Mathews.

With many ways for today's moms to connect virtually, Robinson values the personal conversations -- often held at age-specific round tables during Multiple Connections meetings -- and thinks they have more of an effect.
It may be hard to recall, now that Streep has become our thespian in chief, that her acting hasn't always been universally acclaimed. One famous detractor, New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael, found Streep's studied perfection bloodless. “[A]fter I've seen her in a movie,” Kael observed in her “Sophie's Choice” review, “I can't visualize her from the neck down.”

The mood turns more somber as we near Khao Lak, one of the areas hit hardest by the Dec. 26, 2004 tsunami. Reminders of that lethal wave still remain. One hotel looks struck by a tornado, its wall-less rooms filled with debris. A police boat remains where the receding water left it, perhaps a mile inland, to serve as a memorial to those who died. Joom lost a friend on a coastal island, she tells us softly, and Keam, his crocodile-smile fading for the first time today, recalls how he frantically ushered guests upstairs to safety at the resort where he worked at the time, returning twice to the lobby before being forced to swim for his life.

CLEVELAND, Ohio -- A week of action on East Ninth Street is about wrapped up as filmmakers move production to Public Square outside Tower City for "The Avengers" movie.
A spokesman with Teachers' Retirement System of the State of Illinois was loathe to call the situation a "loophole" or a "grandfather clause." Instead, David Urbanek said lawmakers made no changes to existing membership requirements when they revised the pension. So pension officials knew that aspiring teachers might make a rush to join through substitute teaching.
But the market for quarterbacks is especially thin this offseason, with other options including Jeff Garcia, Dan Orlovsky, Rex Grossman and Ryan Fitzpatrick.
Topping the list of airports where planes were either substantially damaged or destroyed by birds since 2000 were John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York with at least 30 such accidents and Sacramento International Airport in California with at least 28 accidents. Kennedy, the nation's 6th busiest airport, is located amid wetlands that attract birds, and Sacramento International, the nation's 40th busiest, abuts farms whose crops draw birds.
She fought her way outside, where someone called police. Raul Delaprida, a detective who was working an off-duty job nearby, responded and found the dog attacking her on the front yard, Negrey said. When the animal turned on him, the detective fired two shots, striking the dog once, the spokesman said. The dog later died.
Legislators are still scratching their heads, so to speak, over Brownback's veto of a bill concerning licensing exams for barbers. He also scratched a bill transferring control of an oil and gas depletion trust from the state to county governments. That had passed the legislature without a single vote of opposition; the governor's veto is presumed to be a shot at Senate President Steve Morris, the moderate Republican whose district would have benefited from the change.

It must have been that evening that I heard the word 'lonesome' spoken in tones that let me know the privilege attached to it, the kind of democratic privilege that comes with simple deserving. ... In modern culture these are seen as pathologies — alienation and inauthenticity in Europe, maladjustment and depression in the United States. ... I am vehemently grateful that ... I learned to assume that loneliness should be in part pleasure, sensitizing and clarifying ... when I see a man or a woman alone, he or she looks mysterious to me, which is to say ... I see another human being clearly.

The reams of data the new-age statisticians are now compiling ad nauseam for NBA teams - the Cavaliers being one of the dozen or so dedicated enough to employ analysts - can be much the same. Looking at columns of bizarre information can make almost no sense to the fans who are so familiar with the standards - points, rebounds and assists.

Charlize Theron eschews vanity as Mavis Gary, a bitter former prom queen who ghostwrites a "teen lit" book series that is on its last legs. Mavis learns via the web that her high school boyfriend, Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson, convincing as a regular guy), just became a new dad. With her yapping Pomeranian in tow, Mavis returns to dreary Mercury, Minn., to steal back Buddy. Though Mavis is a mess — she's an alcoholic who compulsively pulls out her hair — she "cleans up" nicely.

iPAD SALES: Apple sold 11.8 million iPads in the quarter, the one area of Tuesday's earnings announcement that could be seen as disappointing. The Cupertino company launched a new model of the device this quarter, which usually means a bigger bounce in sales than Apple showed. The total represented a 22.4 percent drop from the holiday shopping quarter, and many analysts were expecting the company to sell more than 12 million iPads in the quarter. Still, Apple increased iPad sales 151 percent from the same quarter of 2011, and CEO Tim Cook seemed pleased with the result. "The new iPad is off to a great start, and across the year you're going to see a lot more of the kind of innovation that only Apple can deliver," he said in the news release.

My sense is that we have only a fragment. Perhaps Wallace was going for something truly massive, with an even larger scope than the 1,000-page plus "Infinite Jest." What we get in this book is just the arrival of young Wallace and other recent hires (GS-9s) at the tax-processing center (REC) in Peoria, Ill., and 500-plus pages in, we await the entrance of the group's genius leader, Dr. Merrill Errol Lehrl.

Then came the U.S. economic crash, and Citigroup, the majority owner at the time, bailed out. Homes stood unfinished, and property values plummeted. Enter Homex, one of Mexico's largest residential developers, which bought the Inn at Loreto Bay, the golf course and more than 80 acres of land to develop in early 2010. In the past year, homeowners have reported new model homes, new construction, new restaurants, and improved roads. Homex has continued to adhere to environmentally sound construction techniques outlined in the original master plan, and there is hope that that this time the development that could be the largest sustainable resort community in North America will take off.

Sleepy is one of the most popular, challenging and well-kept layouts in the area, especially for a municipally-owned course. Golfweek Magazine ranked it the No. 1 muni course and the third-best public course in the state last year. The survey voters obviously were satisfied with the walking rate of $27 for 18 holes and the riding rate of $40 during the week and after 2 p.m. on weekends.

Pages 135 to 144: Andrea Leckey was hiking with her 12- and 13-year-old children and the family dog when she heard loud talking followed by gunshots. She was asked how many shots. Answer: Two and two -- so four altogether. She was asked how much time elapsed between the shots. Answer: Well not much, but it was like two, boom-boom, boom-boom. Question: In between the first boom-boom and the second boom-boom, did you hear any more loud talking? Answer: Um, I heard not yelling ... but just loud talking. Leckey said since she had her children with her, she paused on the trail leading down to the parking lot, uncertain what to do. She waited to see if anyone was running but saw people just walking. She wondered if it was nothing. She encountered three other hikers and asked them if that had sounded like gunfire to them. They said, "Yes, something is going on. There is a police officer yelling for someone to put the knife down and we decided to walk away from it." Leckey waited a few minutes more and began to hear police sirens so she decided it was safe to return to her car in the parking lot. She had parked near the visitor center so her children could use the restroom, so the path back to her car took her past the scene. They saw a body lying on the ground. She said she couldn't see the front of the man because he was facing away. She said there were police officers there and she saw one officer hugging another officer. Before she drove away she spoke briefly to a park employee who told her the police wanted to clear the parking lot. She didn't talk to police at the scene and was contacted later after police had seen her being interviewed on the news.

Schumaker, promoted from Triple-A Memphis Friday following a four-game rehab assignment, stayed down for more than a minute before rising and making several throws to left fielder Matt Holliday. At that point Schumaker told Matheny and trainer Chris Conroy that he was unable to continue and was lifted for Eric Komatsu. The club announced Schumaker's removal as a managerial decision after he had the wind knocked from him. A strained right oblique suffered on March 16 had forced Schumaker to open the season on the disabled list.

"Montauk" seems more in keeping with Wainwright's previous material. It could have been taken straight from "Want One" or "Want Two." The song is an ode to his daughter Viva, and Wainwright dreams of the day when she will visit his house in Montauk. The song is touchingly personal, mentioning the quirks of Wainwright and his fiancée Jorn Weisbrodt.

There is, indeed, a likely coalition against the gay marriage act. Leaders in my own faith, the Catholic Church, are drumming up a bandwagon to get signatures for referendum against the act.

Michael Lloyd/The OregonianMark Weislogel, a mechanical engineering professor, describes Portland State University's new drop tower to physics students from Tualatin High School. The tower, one of three in the nation, is used to create nearly weightless conditions for objects in a 400-pound metal canister that is dropped five stories. High speed video cameras record experiments as they are subjected to zero gravity for about two seconds while the canister falls. "Oh, I hope this works," says Professor Mark Weislogel, as he and visitors watch a silver rectangle box the size of a small refrigerator rise slowly inside a metal-framed tower in the engineering building atrium.

The light rail tracks on Conway Street near Camden Yards are part of the course and have presented an engineering challenge. During the race, they will be covered with a mixture of asphalt and mesh, which organizers hope will hold as the race cars zoom over them. As a result, light rail service will be temporarily divided into two lines, the northern run stopping at Baltimore Street and the southern run stopping at Hamburg Street. Shuttle buses will connect the two. Baseball fans riding light rail to the Orioles-Blue Jays games a few days before the race will be deposited a few blocks farther north or south of Camden Yards than usual. (The Orioles, it seems, are doing their best to minimize the disruption this will cause by rapidly diminishing the degree of fan interest in attending games.)

This is disturbing, though not in the way Beinart intends. Many people form their views of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on snapshot impressions, often shorn of the most basic context. That's a shame, but at least most of these people don't go on to write books on the subject. Journalists, by contrast—and Beinart is a former editor of the New Republic who currently teaches journalism at City University of New York—are supposed to, you know, dig deeper. Get the full picture. Go where the facts lead.
Cal State East Bay, for example, at first had plenty of room and liked the geographic diversity of the exchange students. Now in tighter economic times, the school still wants to stay in the program, which brings 67 out-of-staters to the Hayward campus, in part to help keep reciprocity alive for Californians who travel beyond the borders. "We see this as being a good citizen of California," said Greg Smith, a campus enrollment administrator.
Damon, Johansson, and Fanning are such naturals that for long passages the contrivances of the screenplay by Crowe and Aline Brosh McKenna are not apparent. But the filmmakers insufficiently stir the lumpy metaphors, chief among them that for animals, as for humans, there is a difference between cages and enclosures. A cage inhibits movement and growth, not so an enclosure, which has boundaries but permits circulation and interaction with others.

"They've also turned into a solid line," Payne said. "They've taken a large majority of their shifts from our zone or the neutral zone and created our game in the offensive zone. They've done their job so far. It's very important that the rest of these guys take another step - that would be a good step for us to take tomorrow."

Moore, who has harbored a dislike of guns since he was shot in the leg with a BB gun as a teen, says he tried to resist attempts by directors to make Bond tougher.
"There's a lot of different variables," Birrell said. "We can look at a start here (South Lake Tahoe) and finish at Northstar. If we have to reverse it and not hit the whole circuit, those are things we'll look at."

"We have to raise expectations that every one has the right and obligation to work,'' Baffuto said. "What I hope will happen is that everyone who goes to get services — from Vocational Services, the Division of Developmental Disabilities or Mental Health — work is the first option they have to consider. We need to provide the supports and services for people with disabilities, and we do," he said, noting the Arc and another agency provided job coaching when Byrne first started at Delbarton.

Both Mahsud and Al Qaeda vowed to take revenge against Musharraf after government forces in July stormed a radical mosque in the capital, killing its chief cleric and dozens of his young disciples, many of whom were from South Waziristan. Even before the government assault on the Red Mosque, both groups had disdained the Pakistani leader as a tool of the West for allying himself with Washington in the fight against Islamic militants.

Williams said that talks were "concepts only" and that Republicans were expected to get back to her soon with a redrawn map and specific information about how it would be configured.
Oregon's governor, John Kitzhaber, stopped the impending execution of two-time convicted killer Gary Haugen, granting a "temporary reprieve ... for the duration of my term in office." Haugen's death sentence had been the subject of extensive review and the prisoner himself had argued that he should die. The governor should either have allowed execution to proceed or commuted the sentence. He did neither, treating the prisoner, the victims' families, and the dozens of court and prison officials in this case with cruel irresponsibility.
Several redistricting experts said it would be tough to draw a district in Franklin County with a higher black voting age population than the one already adopted by Republicans. However, a Hamilton County congressional district could be drawn that has more black voters and gives a Democrat a good chance at winning.
This bill is a lot like the one churning up protests in Wisconsin, except our governor didn't even pretend to like the firefighters and police better by exempting them. Here in Ohio, every public employee could lose his or her right to collectively bargain under this beauty of a bill.

"Pan Am" (10-11 p.m. ABC): Under the spell of "Mad Men," the networks are launching two dramas set in the 1960s. This is easily the more high-flying of the two, which is not to say it soars into the ranks of the best new dramas. Christina Ricci, Kelli Garner, Karine Vanasse and Margot Robbie play airline stewardesses at a time when airline travel was fun. This is more silly soap opera than social drama, but it jets ahead of NBC's "The Playboy Club."
They sorely missed their offense, though Nashville thought it tied it with 7 minutes 12 seconds remaining. But officials waved off the power-play goal because a whistle blew before the puck crossed the line.

Monterroso said the passage of Arizona's immigration law is galvanizing Latinos the same way Prop. 187 did in California. Arizona's immigration law makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally. It states that an officer engaged in a lawful stop, detention or arrest shall, when practicable, ask about a person's legal status when reasonable suspicion exists that the person is in the U.S. illegally.

Green's experience with homicide cases is relatively brief. He spent just a year in the unit in 2002 as a sergeant, though officials said he has extensive investigative experience and once worked in internal affairs.

But action is required. It is late in the fiscal year. The irresponsible budgeting of the past, coupled with failed tax policies which lie like a heavy, wet blanket suffocating tax revenues and job growth, have required these extraordinary steps. Despite this bold action, remember, we have not taken one dime from classroom instruction, not forced one penny of increase in our property taxes.

Redondo, of Globe, is believed to have shot and killed Shuhandler during a traffic stop in Gilbert. He is charged with first-degree murder, four counts of drive-by shooting and 19 counts of aggravated assault.

Some cable networks are also staying in the same place, including USA, Lifetime, HGTV and AMC. Below channel 100, in fact, most networks don't change position. (A few do, though, so check the "channels and changes" mailing to be sure about any on which you record regularly.) Above 100, there is lots of change, with the stated intent to group channels by their similar themes.
While the show is very much an ensemble piece, the compelling psychological black hole in the middle of it all is Don Draper. He's slick, smooth, drinks too much, is tortured, haunted and ultimately on the run from himself. His job, like his purpose in life, is to sell illusion. Back in the first season, when it was revealed that Draper was really Dick Whitman and that he'd assumed his current identity from a dead Korean War soldier, ad agency co-founder Bert Cooper (Robert Morse) simply shrugged it off. Truth, it seemed, was a cheap commodity.

During a behind-the-scenes preview about a week ago, I walked through the Transformers attraction with the lights on and the ride vehicles off. At the time, I was impressed by the thematic layers of set dressing and props I found throughout the ride. But much of that military bunker motif was lost when I climbed aboard the ride for the first time and seemingly raced through the attraction in the dark. Like an ornate proscenium framing a theater's stage, much of the detail disappeared when the lights went down and my eyes zoomed in on the movie screens.

Technically, the Keys won't be the first act to play at Revel, either. The hotel is opening a second performance space called the Social, a smaller room than the 5000-seat Ovation Hall. (This is likely to be similar to the division at the Borgata -- the Event Center handles the really big acts, and the Music Box takes care of the more intimate shows.) Revel is planning a soft opening -- they're calling it an eight-week preview -- on Apr. 2, and the casino is marking the occasion with a Social performance by Danish noise-pop the Raveonettes.

The third, Camp Margaret Bates in Macedonia, closed several years ago.

Democrats leaped at what they saw as a chance to champion lower- and middle-income Americans by accusing Republicans of threatening a wide tax increase unless their demands are met. If Congress doesn't act, workers will see their take-home checks cut by 2 percentage points beginning Jan. 1, when this year's 4.2 percent payroll tax is set to revert to its normal 6.2 percent.
The Oct. 30, 2010, email was from Steve Mitchell, managing director of Argonaut Private Equity, a major Solyndra investor, to Ken Levit, executive director of the George Kaiser Family Foundation. Both organizations are controlled by George Kaiser, an Oklahoma billionaire who was a "bundler" for President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign and a frequent White House visitor in 2009 and 2010. Argonaut invested $400 million in the solar company. Mitchell also served on Solyndra's board of directors.

It's not known what Chen's intentions are: Some say he wants to stay in China. But negotiating any exit from U.S. custody is likely to be difficult for the Obama administration. China is likely to be wary of any concessions, fearing they might embolden other activists.
Once again, the dazzle of the new "Sherlock" series is how the writers adhere adoringly to the original texts, while entirely modernizing them at the same time. As impossible as that may seem, Moffat, Gatiss and fellow writer Steve Thompson pull it off so deftly, it is useful to listen carefully to the seeming asides and throwaway lines to appreciate just how brilliant it is.

The persistence of alternate theories is a downer for Steve Hager, editor emeritus of High Times magazine, who considers himself an expert on the holiday's roots.
All in all, you wouldn't know that Europe has suffered through an economic crisis as brutal as ours, because strong social programs in the social democracies we love to visit — England, Italy and France — keep people at work, which is part of the problem. Governments that don't have the resources to pay for such programs — Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain — have needed bailouts from neighbors, generating ill will and doomsday scenarios about the impending collapse of the European Union. If you think that's of marginal interest to tourists, you've forgotten what it was like to travel on the Continent before the advent of open borders and a single currency.
Plans are to save the Davis in stages, first digitizing the main theater <U+0097> the Grand Lady <U+0097> and to ready it for other performing arts events. Ultimately, the Davis would become a nonprofit community theater.
When you choose to buy more earth-friendly items, you are sending a powerful message to manufacturers and retailers. There are important questions you should ask yourself before buying anything.

"For two weeks, they just sat there," he said. "Then they started selling. Now we have people coming in and saying, 'I hear you have a special '80s vinyl section.' "
Nick Hundley: "For the All-Star Game not to mean anything. I think it's embarrassing for that game to determine home-field advantage (in the World Series) after 162 games. And I would make every playoff series seven games and eliminate all the off days so one starter can't start three games in a series. So it's more a real look at your entire team and not just your ace.

On this lovely, crisp morning, we don't see another soul during our hourlong walk. The steep climb to the top of the bluff affords a breathtaking view of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains, still lacy with snow.
Cornelius leaders knew 15 years ago that the roads needed upgrades. The town of 11,000 has the highest rate of low-income and Latino residents in the county -- two groups likely to include more walkers because of cultural or financial reasons. The town is also home to a large population of people with disabilities, and the lack of sidewalks was unsafe for families like the Arouses.
The new fees would be based directly on the assessed value of properties — $171 for the owner of the township average home assessed at $181,740, Mayor Mark Smith said.
"What we see, in most cases, is that tornado damages are covered substantially by insurance," Josephson said.
Asked what he'd wear on gameday, Fickell said whatever his wife, Amy, puts out for him. He did say he expects to wear black so that the players on the field can easily see him stand out on the sideline when signaling in plays. So expect the same black golf shirt Fickell wore as an assistant. But he also noted, astutely, that Nike has a big say in the gameday attire.
The horror comes almost as quickly as it does in the film's spectacular trailer. Terrorists attack an American compound and kill more than a hundred people, including an FBI agent. The event seems all too plausible in its evocation of the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, but exactly how does America respond? By sending in an A-Team with CSI skills -- four FBI agents who are given five days to solve the crime.
Mayor Sally Faith has refused to say whether she asked Corley to depart. She has said only that he made the decision and that she supports him in that decision. Corley has not commented.

Sarah East Johnson, performer, artistic director, LAVA:
He was blind in one eye and deaf in one ear, and his face was terribly scarred by the tubercular lesions and smallpox he had endured as a child. He suffered several emotional breakdowns and battled throughout his life with depression. He was -- even by the none-too-fastidious standards of his day -- physically dirty and careless of his clothing. He had a morbid terror of being alone, which makes his legendarily entertaining performance in company seem somehow touching.
Ohio's mandated power reduction "means essentially no growth in electricity use over the next 15 to 20 years," Alexander said.
He was, of course, not without his faults. He arrived in the United States just a few years before the Civil War. And although he would have thought it inconceivable to personally own slaves, he badly waffled on the issue of slavery as an institution. And in churchly circles, his theological stridency gave him a number of enemies just as it won him many friends.
But recently, Hopkins had decided he needed to get a more reliable day job to support his family, and his music-making became something he did in his non-work hours.

Under public pressure, some fast food chains, grocery retailers and school districts say they will no longer mix LFTB with hamburger. Walmart will offer customers a choice, and so will the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Around the globe, the usual troubles -- endless bloodshed between Palestinians and Israelis, fighting between U.S. soldiers and insurgents in Afghanistan, the meltdown of anarchic African countries such as Somalia and Congo -- mostly got worse. Simmering tensions between Russia and Georgia blew up into a short-lived invasion. Zimbabwe, once a breadbasket, is now in danger of becoming a failed state. The economic downturn is hurting the rest of the world as badly as, if not worse than, the United States.
Duh, you might say.

Now is the time to re-examine international safety regulations, particularly as the investigation reveals what went wrong off the Tuscan coast. The International Maritime Organization should conduct a stem-to-stern review of safety system requirements and damage control and stability criteria for passenger vessels.

That strategy, authorities say, included hiring a hit man from Chicago named "Oscar." He had connections to the Latin Kings and was supposed to kill a key witness against Esteves: Junior the Panamanian. Bergrin warned that the killing could not resemble a hit, authorities said. "I got it all figured out ... put on a ski mask and make it look like a robbery," Bergrin said, according to authorities.
I am all for better living through chemistry. I eschew granola in all its forms, typically leaving anything marked "natural" on the grocery-store shelf, and for all four of my babies' deliveries I received an epidural as early as I could convince the anesthesiologist on call to hand it over. Particularly as a mom of four school-aged kids, I'd fight like heck to live if I got sick. But later on, I'm not so sure.
The PUCO, responsible for the stability of the state's power "gird," is concerned that the utility shutdowns could ultimately lead to higher electric rates as the region's ability to generate power shrinks and utilities preoccupied with their own finances walk away.

She says another stumbling block to discussions about CAM may be different perceptions about what practices are really relevant to your overall health. CAM encompasses many different types of activities and treatments, from tai chi to herbal tea. Some, says Day, may not seem worth troubling a busy doctor with.

Technologically, the system is a marvel. There are no tollbooths. Indeed, there is no sign at all that this is a toll road except for actual signs that say so. The toll is collected in myriad ways. You can sign up for an account and get a little coded sticker for your windshield. Or you can wait until they bill you, using your license plate to track you down. Apparently, it works. Unless your commute is between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., in which case it's free, you can't escape.
So yes, there have been plenty of just plain bad speeches over the years, from the too-brief (Clark Gable's entire one for "It Happened One Night"? "Thank you.") to the simply bathetic (I'm thinking of you, Sally Field, and I really, really don't like it).
Arizona's cities and towns are gaining a national reputation for piling it on with sales taxes, and the bite is often higher in outlying areas.

"The underlying narcotic that you were looking for," Hardin said at one point, and Novitzky corrected him – anabolic steroids and human growth hormone are scheduled drugs, not narcotics.
This is a soft, fruity, easy-to-drink, crowd-pleasing red with blackberry and raspberry flavors and a hint of vanilla. It's a medium-bodied red that's not very complex, but I often prefer simple wines with simple meals. It would make a good pair with such weeknight fare as pizza, pasta and ground beef casseroles. In fact, I thought it was a great complement to the "All American Flame Grilled" Boca Burger I threw in the microwave. It's amazing how a glass of wine can turn even a veggie burger into a classier kind of meal.
As battered as Harry was, a couple of tugs from the bottle of Jack Daniel's I'd brought along for medicinal purposes revived him, and as we drove through the concrete and glass canyons of downtown Atlanta, he grabbed Frazier and me by the scruffs of our necks and exclaimed in his gravelly, Southern drawl: "Men such as us should never die!"

CLEVELAND, Ohio — Should you have cancer and need chemotherapy administered intravenously, say five times a week for six weeks at a hospital or medical office, or require injections once a day for three weeks at an outpatient facility, chances are your health insurance will pick up most, if not all, of the tab. It's considered a medical benefit, like surgery.

If a problem crops up, students are advised to talk it over in a calm, respectful manner. To think of creative alternatives and compromises. Most importantly, to keep an open mind and a positive attitude. Students need to remember, "Things are going to be OK," says Wilson.
One development that made the animation easier since the days of the studio’s Oscar-winning “Wallace and Gromit” shorts was a new mouth-replacement system. The animators used a 3-D printer to create resin sculptures of each character’s mouth making dozens of shapes. Some 7,000 were printed and then popped on the characters’ faces to form words and convey emotion. In the past, the animator had to remold a mouth by hand for every single shot.

A: I get that question a lot. There are a lot of parallels between challenges of the disease and the challenges of climbing a mountain. When my mother was diagnosed, I started to learn about the disease and felt helpless because I didn't know anything about it before. I thought, "What would have gotten me to learn about Alzheimer's disease when I was in my 20s and 30s?" Not going to a lecture about it. But if someone invited me to a Seven Summits slide show, and they talked about Alzheimer's, then I would've been there in a minute. For the mountaineering, of course, but I would have listened.

She sits down to eat lunch with the rest of her class at Bankbridge Development Center, the desks arranged in a U-shape. Her speech therapist, Rachel Giuliano, sits next to her to help her eat, but Cailey’s not interested.

She rests her head on Giuliano’s leg, her tousled hair falling over her eyes.

Giulietta’s Venetian lair saw the return of the burlesquers in a kind of commedia dell’arte-style bordello, complete with a mask or two. Mezzo-soprano Ekaterina Gubanova captured the courtesan’s opportunistic spirit. But the famous barcarolle “Belle nuit, o nuit d’amour” didn’t quite have the opulent sound it could have. Singing with Gubanova, mezzo-soprano Kate Lindsey, as Hoffmann’s muse and friend Nicklausse, seemed too light-voiced. Still, in her crucial role, she was never less than dramatically engaging.

Messner is the 19-year-old son of a butcher, a good boy who tries to do everything right and describes himself as having "a great talent for being satisfied."

A He was always trying to find the ideal piano -- extremely difficult to do, when you're unable to hear. So it's difficult to clearly say what he was looking for in a piano, because the sound he was seeking maybe was more in his head.

Rutgers professor Alan Rosenthal, who was the tie-breaking member on New Jersey’s redistricting commission in 1992, said several factors beyond population shifts may sway the redistricting.

2010 Remy Gresser Kritt Alsace Gewurztraminer ($26, 13%): This family estate in Andlau is now firmly committed to biodynamics. Its Gewurztraminer from the gravelly Kritt site is dark and stony, redolent of pear eau-de-vie, spice cookie and dried apricot. It needs a couple years to blossom, but you can perceive the textural power - a heady, rich wine waiting to show its full potential. (Importer: Martine's Wines)

For anything other than a one or two-family home, Minnesota requires a Reduced Pressure Zone (RPZ) valve on the water supply for the boiler.

Obama holds an edge among independent voters, an important but easily misunderstood group. Independents neither identify with nor lean toward the Democratic or Republican parties, but not all are swing voters. Some are strongly liberal or conservative, so they can be just as committed to a candidate as some partisans.

"You can devote more time to them, they're getting more reps and you're getting to see how they react to some situations," Whisenhunt said. "Some of the instinctive things and what they've been coached on. Like a receiver when he beats a defensive back, is he going to get over the top, is he going to the run to the sideline?"

Hawaii Forest & Trail's Kona Coffee & Craters Tour: Kona is known for its coffee. But its landscape, which rises from the ocean to more than 6,000 feet above sea level in just a few short miles, is just as impressive. By taking this tour, you can get your arms around both. Explore barren volcanic landscape, peer into deep craters, examine the scraggly plant life that somehow manages to survive and even scramble through a lava tube or two. Then head to Mountain Thunder, a highly prized organic coffee farm and processor for an in-depth explanation of how coffee is grown and processed.

As for nibbles, instead of the usual samosa pastries and baji fritters, go for "chicken 65," superheated fried chicken nuggets dipped in ground chile batter. Or have egg bonda sitting beside its mint-coconut chutney and a tamarind date sauce. These deep-fried shaggy-crusted orbs look like a delicious Modernist Cuisine experiment.
Along with the gold, a selection of ceramic tomb figures and stone tools accompany this exhibition. These are not as striking as the gold artifacts, but they are educational and give some historic and cultural context.
Serious baseball fans likely scored 100 percent, though Cardinals GM John Mozeliak has a tricky name to pronounce (moe-ZAY-lock). The guess here is a large percentage of people in Chicago caught up in Theo Mania this week couldn't out Jon Daniels (the Rangers' GM) at a Starbucks. Yet those same people seem certain that Theo Epstein is the answer to whatever ails the Cubs.
But that's unlikely to happen. Many in Charles' inner circle say he's waited too long to step aside - even for his son.

Those weaknesses can be fixed during film sessions and by spending endless hours in a gym. More troubling is Evans' lack of production in two other critical areas: defense and rebounding. He has averaged only 2.5 rebounds during his last six games, including none in Friday's loss to Oklahoma City. He seldom gets his large, quick hands on loose balls anymore and seems emotionally disengaged. (In fairness, the Kings' defensive commitment in general is nonexistent. The last three opponents shot 53, 58 and 52 percent, respectively.)

It was a utopian vision, of course, and one that could have come only from an upper-class bloke with time on his hands. But the idea has endured. Whenever you see a stoneware mug, a hand-knit cap or a tulip-and-tendril-embroidered curtain, you're looking at Morris' legacy. Today, thanks to him, a thriving community of high-quality potters, silversmiths, cabinetmakers, weavers, furniture designers, cheese crafters and other cottage manufacturers flourishes in the Cotswolds. Dropping in on these artists as part of a tour of the more well-known sights is a great way to get a personal feel for the region and find some lovely gifts, as well.
In "Felix Starro," two generations of Old World faith healers -- armed with tiny bags of corn syrup "blood" and a bucket of chicken livers -- arrive in San Francisco to perform the Holy Blessed Extraction of Negativities on devout Filipinos desperate for a miracle cure.

A: We have programs to let our employees donate time and money to community efforts. But we invented this idea of social virtual goods. When the earthquake hit Haiti and the tsunami hit Japan, we were proud that we were the first money doled out in both. Our teams started taking the virtual goods, creating specialized goods in the game that you could buy where all of the money went to these causes, and they let our players show off that they were doing something about it.

In education we teach more than just reading, writing, and math. We also teach our children to work together, support one another and to be compassionate. When there is a problem to be solved, we teach them to sit down together and figure it out by listening and being respectful of one another's opinion. After all, everyone has a right to be heard because you never know, you might just learn something that changes your perception of a problem, understand someone else's point of view or even reframe a core belief. Listening to seek understanding is a higher order skill, a life skill we teach our children.

Which is why the original picture worked so well. By 1969, movie fans had a huge emotional investment in the star — something “True Grit” (and, later, “The Cowboys,” and “The Shootist”) realized, and used. To see those movies was to see a great hero grown old. It was to watch your own youthful illusions under attack.

Crudites. Gone are the baby carrots, raw broccoli and celery sticks that mom used to put out with dips; instead, go for plates of sliced fennel, radishes and endive leaves. Little Gem lettuces and sliced jicama are also good choices.

You can order a combination platter if you want to try several different things, or choose from the appetizers, entrees, side dishes and about eight homemade desserts. Prices are extremely reasonable, there's a depth of flavor in every bite and even the falafel ($7) is a surprise. Instead of the usual deep-fried brown brick, it's a large, quickly fried round ball with a light, soft green, ground chick pea and fava bean center seasoned with fresh herbs. Same with the kibbi ($7). I'm used to an over-baked ball of lamb and cracked bulghur wheat, but Hage's is shaped like slices of meat loaf, loaded with sautéed onions and pine nuts and served with fresh yogurt and cucumbers. Delicious.
There's probably no cause for alarm, but that doesn't mean that the federal government has taken all the reasonably appropriate steps to protect and reassure consumers. South Korea halted imports of U.S. beef for five years after a previous case was discovered in this country, and two retailers there stopped selling last week. Indonesia is also banning imports. The U.S. beef industry itself should be calling for extra measures to protect the reputation of its products.

One key goal of the law, which takes effect immediately, is to end the practice in which some city of Chicago municipal and labor union workers have taken leaves of absence from their city jobs, moved to full-time positions with their unions and then collected pensions from both.

We've got to get that focus back and we move on, rather than thinking about what's going on in a different building that we can't control."

But the bottom line is that Oregon is a vastly different athletic department than when Kent was hired in 1997. The facilities are better. The expectations are higher, all around. The department budget is double what it was when Kent was hired. And failing to be nationally relevant isn't acceptable from a program that should aspire to be more than a perennial question mark.

Bankruptcy poses a smaller challenge when the product or service sold by a company does not involve a long-term relationship after the sale. If Campbell's Soup were to disappear tomorrow, the unused cans of soup in my kitchen would remain as valuable to me as they were when I bought them. The situation of an automaker is quite different.

My fear about a Chrysler bankruptcy is that many consumers would respond by marking down the probability that a new Chrysler can be dependably maintained or profitably resold. This in turn would reduce the prices consumers are willing to pay for Chrysler vehicles. Consumers' pessimistic expectations would make the ultimate liquidation of Chrysler more certain.

Each of these translates to, "I am the adult in this relationship and he is the child." I have sisters, too - as in, sisters, not "big" sisters, and I'm not their "little" sister, unless there's a need to distinguish one from another, like, "I have two sisters, and the older/younger one ...

PITTSBURGH, Pa. — They are magical do-overs for an Ohio State offense that has needed them more than a few times this season.

-- Unusual combinations. This same daring approach is being used in combining meat and seafood. A fatty square of pork belly sits on roasted lobster at the Ritz-Carlton; abalone is the unlikely plate mate to pig trotters at Manresa; sweetbreads cozy up to sea urchin roe at Fleur de Lys; and lobster, pig's feet and sweetbreads are blended together in one rich, luxurious patty at La Folie.

A: Ovarian cancer has never had the research funding that breast cancer gets. But when the screening tests for ovarian cancer -- the CA-125 blood test that looks for cancer antibodies and transvaginal ultrasound -- were introduced, everyone was really hopeful that it would become easier to diagnose the disease in its early stages. Now, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has declared that "there is at least moderate certainty that the harms of screening for ovarian cancer outweigh the benefits."

Affirmative action falls into the latter category. Despite the emergence of a black middle class, stark inequities in income and education persist, and they put minority applicants at a disadvantage with their peers in seeking acceptance to colleges and universities. Opponents of affirmative action glibly use terms like "meritocracy" and "a level playing field," but academic success often reflects a privileged upbringing, and the playing field between black and white Americans is still far from level. Redressing racial disparities that are reflected in lower grades and test scores is not racism, reverse or otherwise.

But Baltimore is not Sanford, Fla., and nothing like the level of racial tension evident there has occurred here. In fact, there is no reason to believe that the Trayvon Martin case precludes a fair trial for the Werdesheims. There have been a number of news stories that have noted the similarities between the two cases, but the charges, evidence and applicable laws are entirely different. There may be some jurors in this city — or in any of Maryland's counties — who could not have objectively considered this case because of their opinions about the handling of Trayvon Martin's, but they could have been weeded out in the jury selection process. The brothers' decision to give up their right to a trial before a jury of their peers should eliminate that concern altogether.

Kovalchuk spoke of his line's performannce.
Woodson said he'll switch Anthony over to power forward, where he scored 29.8 points per game in April when Stoudemire was dealing with a back injury. From there Woodson can either put J.R. Smith in at shooting guard and Landry Fields or Steve Novak at small forward, or he could put in Fields at shooting guard and Novak at small forward while leaving Smith as the sixth man. Fields started for Shumpert in Game 2, but with Stoudemire out of the lineup, Woodson might want more scoring and that gives Smith the upper hand.

Other priorities were more important for the city's working-class families.

And the Red, White and Blue Fund has spent $1 million to boost Santorum and criticize Romney over the last two weeks. About half of the money paid for direct mail to Republican voters.

"I would be if I were interfering with weddings that people can afford to spend the money on and that make them happy," she said. "From my mail, I know people go into great debt and try to get money out of their relatives and friends, so they can't afford it, and it does not make them happy.

Although these attacks did not cause casualties, they nevertheless reflect the lethal expansion of AQAP's skills and operational capabilities.

But the orchestra conveyed the work’s raw power stunningly. Act I flew by, with an intoxicating sweep given to its heady, sensual love arias.

End zone: The Ravens ruled out starting wide receiver Lee Evans (left ankle) for Sunday. Evans did not practice this week, and he joins wide receiver David Reed (left shoulder strain) and rookie cornerback Jimmy Smith (high left ankle sprain) as three players who will sit out Sunday's game. Rookie Torrey Smith could make his first career start in Evans' place. … Despite missing three consecutive practices, starting left guard Ben Grubbs is listed as questionable. Grubbs did not play in Sunday's loss to the Tennessee Titans after straining ligaments in his toe. Cornerback Chris Carr, who was limited all week by a left hamstring injury, is also questionable. … Three starters in center Matt Birk (left knee), defensive end Cory Redding (toe) and nose tackle Terrence Cody are probable. Birk practiced fully for the second straight day, while Redding and Cody were limited for the second consecutive day. … For the Rams, running back Steven Jackson (strained left quad) is listed as questionable after practicing on a limited basis for the second straight day. Starting outside linebacker Ben Leber (groin) is questionable as are running back Carnell Williams (hamstring) and defensive end C.J. Ah You (wrist). … Starting wide receiver Danny Amendola (dislocated left elbow) is listed as doubtful even though he has not practiced this week. ... Tight end Michael Hoomanawanui (calf) and rookie wide receiver Greg Salas (ribs) are both probable. … Grubbs underwent an MRI on his injured toe Thursday, but results were negative, coach John Harbaugh said. "It's still sore," Grubbs said. "It's still a day-to-day thing. Every morning, I hope I wake up feeling a little bit better, but I guess because of the size of the joint, it takes forever for the swelling to go out. Right now, I think that's what's causing most of my pain, just the inflammation." … Rookie LaQuan Williams might return a few kicks Sunday, but it appears for now that Lardarius Webb will add kick returns to his plate that already includes starting at cornerback and returning punts. "Webby's in great shape, and he did it in the first game of the year, and we anticipate using him however we can use him throughout the game on defense and special teams," special teams coordinator Jerry Rosburg said during his weekly briefing Thursday. "I don't think that's going to change. And just like with all the games, we have a number of guys that can do a number of things."

There are differences between candidates on important issues, but we don't attack each other with those kind of terrible terms. I am not anti-immigrant. I'm pro-immigrant. I like immigration. Immigration has been an extraordinary source of strength in this country. As you, I'm sure, know, immigrants form more businesses than domestic-born Americans. The immigration population in this country has created great vitality in our economy, as well as in our culture."

A year ago, after the Buffaloes gathered in the home of their coach only to watch in disbelief as the NCAA selection committee snubbed CU when bids were issued to the tournament field of 68, Boyle sat on a chair in his family room and fumed.

Q: My sister's 8-year-old son is beginning to notice some of his friends telling their parents to stop embarrassing them. Now, my nephew is doing the same but for silly things, like when she gives him a kiss on the cheek before he gets out of the car for school in the mornings. Because I am his aunt and pretty close to him, I asked what it was that she was doing that upset him, and he really did not come up with anything. Her feelings are hurt, mainly because she is a hard-working single mom with two jobs and cherishes their time together when they do get to hang out. I was wondering if he might just be repeating what some of his friends are saying, but really appreciates these things. How could we get to the root of the problem without asking him a million questions and clouding the situation even more?

Pages 40-46: April Hill, a full-time executive assistant at the arboretum, was at her desk inside the visitors center that afternoon. She knew police had been summoned, and she saw her boss outside the visitors center awaiting the arrival. Suddenly, through her office window, she saw a police officer, gun drawn and aimed, walking backwards away from her. She walked toward the window, but when she heard two gunshots, she ducked behind a filing cabinet. From there, she heard another two shots fired, and she estimated that 20 seconds had passed between the first two shots and the second two. She waited a while longer, then returned to her desk. After police arrived, she said she drew the window blinds and went back to work.
There's certainly a compelling case to be made for adding criminal penalties to Maryland's child abuse reporting law, as recently suggested by state Sen. Nancy Jacobs, a Harford County Republican. For one, it would send a clear message that those who witness abuse and fail to report it — or worse, deliberately cover it up — are culpable, not just those who actually commit such crimes. It might also give people who would rather not get involved in the messy process of a child abuse investigation a reason to overcome their reluctance to implicate a neighbor, acquaintance or family member. Such people could tell themselves they had no choice but to act or face criminal prosecution themselves. Given that 90 percent of child victims are abused by people they know, that could be a powerful incentive for witnesses to step forward.

The Sporting News also writes of former Florida safety Bryan Thomas, saying he was given a medical hardship to clear a scholarship spot. Running players off is something that absolutely must be monitored, and the Big Ten does that. The new plan with most major schools offering multi-year scholarships is another step toward protecting players from these situations. I have questioned Meyer about his roster management at Ohio State and will continue to keep tabs on the players who leave and the circumstances under which they depart, but Meyer's reputation in this area is not one of a coach who constantly oversigns at the expense of current players who are following the rules but not producing. Some other SEC coaches have a problem with that.

It is inconceivable to me that outsourcing our fine Police Department would even be a topic for discussion. These men and women protect us, not because it's their job, but because they actually care about the well-being of the citizens of this town.

Simply put, you can't put a price tag on our safety. If the ballot measure was allowed to go through and it didn't pass, then so be it. But for you to not even allow us the opportunity is shameful, careless and irresponsible.

Munich must also find a way of its own to score against a team that has given up only six goals in 10 matches. And it certainly has the weapons.

The concise menu also includes two salads (each $8) and two burgers (each $8.75).

There are also occasional vegetarian specials.

Those who believe that government has magical "transformative powers" also seek to convince us that all of our ills can be blamed on someone else. That was the whole "hope and change" shell game Obama played on the country in 2008. "Just vote for me and all your problems will go away." If government could make you feel better about yourself, it would be a bar.

Its shallowness, its two-layered flows of freshwater riding atop salt, its structures of filtering shellfish and burrowing worms and clams, its vast grass beds that could absorb and rerelease nutrients — all of this and more enabled the bay to retain, recycle, and recycle again whatever food it could get. Think of it like swishing a tasty drink around in your mouth for a long time, extracting all of the goodness.

Weiss called it "drive-by extinction" when his research showed how exhaust fumes (nitrous oxides and ammonia) from cars driving on nearby Interstate 280 fertilize nonnative grasses, allowing them to drive out native wildflowers that support the butterflies. Edgewood now is being restored by rotational mowing, and checkerspot host plant and nectar sources are abundant in the area once again. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service granted a permit to transfer butterflies, in both caterpillar and adult form, from a healthy population at Coyote Ridge to 15 acres of prime habitat at Edgewood. In February 2011, more than 4,000 caterpillars were introduced. Volunteer monitors counted about 130 adults during the flight season (March and April 2011), also noting about 2,000 caterpillars (offspring of those butterflies) this winter. To further the odds of firmly reestablishing this species, another 4,852 caterpillars were introduced in February 2012. More than 100 butterflies have been spotted already this year, a strong indicator of success. To further increase the likelihood of success, additional adults were introduced on April 3, 2012. The larvae were reintroduced into their historic home, in the serpentine grassland between the serpentine loop and the clarkia trails. The site can be observed from the serpentine loop, facing the freeway, and looking across the swale and upslope. The site is protected and not crossed by public trails. Ranger John Trewin says, "We ask people to stay on trails to protect the sensitive habitat, but the views from those trails are spectacular."

Dish after dish set up vibrant contrasts -- brioche-crusted sweetbreads on a pool of sunchoke puree with capers and port, the yin and yang of sweet, salty and rich bouncing around the tongue like a pingpong ball; aged strip loin of beef on a bed of short rib hash with long-stewed mustard greens and fingerling potatoes knit together with a red wine sauce so pure the sommelier could probably tell you the vintage of Pinot Noir Keane used; and succulent bacon-wrapped pork loin arranged over a nest of hen-of-the-wood mushrooms and pork jus enriched with white wine and a little thyme.
Perhaps the day's most impressive numbers were put up by Vikings defensive tackle Myles Wade. Weighing in at 311 pounds, Wade shattered his personal marks in the bench press and vertical jump with 42 reps and 35.5 inches.

Unlike many of today's popular celebrities, Knowles does not use a stylist except for a handful of red carpet events. It's her ability to meld traditional basics in highlighter colors, sporty knits and tribal prints with a refreshingly understated appeal that has drawn attention from the fashion set. When she arrived atJ. Crew's spring 2012 runway presentation last year with her sister, for instance, she wore a sleeveless shocking-pink shell paired with royal blue and gold Jacquard pants — creating quite a contrast with Beyoncé's gold sequin cocktail dress and nude peep-toe heels and showcasing her innate knack for putting together her own outfits.

The money's irrelevant. He's getting $5.5 million this season, plus there's a $500,000 buyout. Owner Mike Ilitch pounced from the shadows at the last second and guaranteed Prince Fielder $217 million. Do you really think he's going to care if he has to eat Inge's $6 million? If he stays, it'll have nothing to do with what they're paying him, but rather how much he could still contribute, if only in a limited reserve role.
In the meantime, Cleveland will celebrate a quarter century of a race that has had ups and downs, been innovative and now partners with United Cerebral Palsy as an official charity that has changed the culture of the event.

During a recent press conference, the mayor noted that the city has seen a drastic reduction in juvenile homicides by nearly 50 percent and shootings by 70 percent over the past four years. And in the past two years, juvenile violence and the rate of juvenile arrests have continued to decline. Faced with such positive results, now is not the time to retreat from the city's obligation to provide safe havens in the form of public recreation for our youth. Further divestment in our public recreation facilities could have the unintended consequence of reversing the hard work that has contributed to a dip in youth violence.

Because in the days since Messrs. Obama and Biden took turns praising Mr. Corzine, it's been revealed that the company Mr. Corzine led was ripping off investors left and right. Oh, and he seems to have lost $1.2 billion. If Mr. Corzine ever goes to trial, the judge should take into account the millions of Americans who have lost all or part of their pensions because of the negligence and/or corruption of people like him. Many Americans will be forced to work long after their intended retirement date due to the type of corporate greed and negligence Jon Corzine represents. Hence, 90 days as a Wal-Mart greeter or cashier might be the appropriate punishment for Mr. Corzine, and for all those fat-cat CEOs who pay such little mind to the financial well-being of their middle-class and pension fund investors.

Two volunteers work several days a week using a computer program where undetermined plants are compared with known published species to find their closest relatives. They then compare the plant they are working with to the species in the list, indicating how they differ. I in turn study their results and decide if the plant really is a new species, then decide on a new name and write up all the details.
"Right now I feel like I'm stronger and faster," he said. "I feel very much like 22, and I'm really 33. So if I was to keep on until I was 26 in my own thinking, that would be good. So that means maybe another four years.

Well, we're not gonna have a plan that runs out of other people's money. We're gonna reduce the entitlement burden on this country. We're gonna tackle Social Security and Medicare, and not 10 years from now. Now. I put forward plans like Paul Ryan, which I support. But we need to do it now. I'm not gonna go into all the details. That's a longer speech. But Social Security and Medicare reform, as I've talked about it, even in places like The Villages in Florida, which is basically a large, huge, retirement community. And when I've talked about Social Security and actually changing benefits, I didn't see a single hand raised that opposed what I was proposing. Why? Because if you have a leader who is willing to go out and educate the American public as to the problems that we confront, and the possible solutions out there, you'd be amazed at how the American people will rally and do what's their duty and do what's necessary to make this country great again.

As a hunter, Nugent has run afoul of the law before.
(On how he thinks Shurmur has handled his five games and if he remembers when he was a first-time head coach if there was ever this much scrutiny)- "Well my first seven games I was 2-5 in Green Bay, that I do remember. One of those wins was just a miracle so it could've been 1-6. I think if you're in this business and you become a head coach it shouldn't surprise you or shock you that you're going to be scrutinized and every little thing is going to be looked at. I think Pat's doing a great job, I really do. I think he communicates well with the players. He's kind of weathered, in my opinion pretty well, this storm cloud that's kind of hit the team early. He didn't have an offseason like I did. I was able to work with and establish some things before we came to training camp when I was a rookie head coach. The players are listening I can tell, I can see. We met on Tuesday, we meet every week and we had a pretty good session on Tuesday. We both kind of vented a little bit and it was real healthy. I really like him a lot. I told him two things, when you're the signal caller, as I was all those years, one of the first things I would every Monday morning was I would come in and I wasn't one of those guys that would look at the game Sunday night. We played the game, I was shot, and I'd wait until Monday. You come in and you look at every call you made, every call if you lost a football game I particular. Could that have been better? Would I have done something different? Did I do the right thing here? You kind of go through that and you're very hard on yourself because calling the game is very, very important. It's important that if you did, in your opinion, make an error or it's reasonable that you correct it, that's why you do that. It's a self-study. I also told him, don't beat himself up so much. Heck, it's football, you know you're a good coach, stuff happens, you're doing the best you can and you've got another game next week. That was my counsel to him on Tuesday. He's doing fine. We're the type of team that will probably be in a lot of close games this year. That's my feeling and certainly you could look at the Oakland game and the Cincinnati game, you could, and say shoot well if this could have gone here, you can do that. But, you lost so it's hard and I think that's what he's going through right now. I'll tell you what, he's a solid guy. I believe in him 100%. I'm not aware and I've told you, as much as I like all of you, I don't read you that much. I'm not aware of the criticism's that much and I don't really care, it's just important that he and I understand one another."

His rhetoric is easy to listen to, but does nothing to help solve the real problems facing the township. Don’t be seduced by Herman Vos’ simplistic diatribe. Vos’ statements on how to streamline the operation of our township are so simplistic that Vos is either purposefully trying to deceive us or he is hopelessly naive about the operation of the town. In either case he does not deserve our vote for mayor.

More than 40 percent of New York state's community college students are so poorly prepared that they need first-year remedial help -- a not unusual pattern. Across the nation, high proportions of college students fail to complete their studies and win degrees. Each dropout or failure not only spells limited life prospects for the student, but a less economically vibrant region where they live.

And, wait, didn't I just see that French globe in the store? "The original globe was broken during the reproduction process," Friedman explains. "I'm the only one who knows my globe's not the original." That fuzzy line between authenticity and the reproduction can rankle purists, who see in the democratization of taste a profusion of tasteful items "devalued," as Paul Goldberger once wrote, in a piece about Friedman when he was at Pottery Barn, "by their very accessibility." But Friedman says he's just trying to bring the things he enjoys to more people. "My house is filled with Libeco-Lagae linens," he says. "They cost $85 a yard." With Restoration, however, he flew to Belgium to meet with Libeco CEO Raymond Libeert. "We were able to buy linen for $14 a yard, bring a value to an American customer they hadn't seen," he says. "We're now their biggest customer in the world." As Cole describes it, "He's breaking open the mysteries of the business." Who could object to that—save the person who paid $85 a yard?

The Congressional Budget Office will report Obama's health care price controls -- payment cuts to doctors and hospitals in Medicare and other programs -- as large, long-term budget savings. The CBO is the most lenient sort of referee, giving credit for a proposed play instead of an actual score. But such reductions are not likely to happen. Every year Congress passes a "doc fix" to avert much smaller cuts. Obama's health care law already pushes Medicare disbursement rates below Medicaid rates -- a level that currently makes it difficult for Medicaid patients to find doctors willing to treat them. The Medicare actuary predicts that cuts already passed by Congress will cause about 15 percent of providers to become unprofitable. Proposing even more drastic reductions is more of a ploy than a plan. But it would look good on paper.

The corpse is revealed to be a down-market private detective with an unsavory habit of illegally tapping people's phones. But who killed him? Paretsky's story poses plenty of questions: Why is Chaim Salanter, the billionaire grandfather of one of the girls in the book club, trying to pay off V.I. to stop investigating the case? And what does it have to do with the talk-show host who devotes so much air time to pillorying Salanter?

Blast Roy for being honest if it makes you feel better. Wish him gone. But know he's devastated over his inability to feel comfortable dropping in and out of the game. It's why he let it rip to two reporters who cared to ask what it feels like to be forgotten. The three-time All-Star said he felt disrespected and under-utilized, and Roy cried out for anyone willing to believe in him anymore. More than what he said, was the tone in which he said it.

Hercules, a mostly residential town of 25,000 on San Pablo Bay, has been hovering on the brink of bankruptcy, in part because of the real estate implosion and a string of redevelopment gambles gone awry.

Wines above 12.5 percent need foods that are richer, heavier and made with flavorful oils.

The situation is even worse in business class, says AlphaFlightGuru's Tim Gibson. He and I agree that the best use of frequent flyer miles is for international trips in business class, and here, he says, a typical traveler's initial success rate is less than 10 percent. His company (www.alphaflightguru.com) specializes in helping business travelers get the most from their miles, and he says his company can ultimately "help 80 percent of the people." But his agents really have to work at it, sometimes mixing and matching airlines within alliances or even use different alliances. But the strategy with the best odds of success, notes Gibson, is to wait to confirm seats until three to seven days prior to departure. That's the time when airlines finally decide how many seats they really aren't going to sell and release them for frequent flyers. Even when clients have to set firm travel dates well in advance, AlphaFlightGuru helps them by providing highly discounted consolidator tickets when the mileage awards don't become available.

How could a song, a show, a poem, a painting do justice to the fallen, those who tried to save them or their surviving loved ones? They can seem as shallow as speeches, as hollow as memorials.

First, calling the requirement a "mandate" reinforces the notion that the government is forcing people into the market for health insurance.

Michelle Williams gives a memorable, believable performance as Monroe, which is no small feat, but she doesn't transform herself into the star (a la Meryl Streep in "The Iron Lady").

5. Quinn figures to be hungry and highly motivated. Again, I don't know why he broke the NCAA rules at North Carolina. I don't know the kid. The Rams are assuring us that he's a good person that comes from a good family. And that he made a terrible mistake that made him feel ashamed. Quinn has said, many times, that he's upset by how he let his teammates down, himself down. Quinn did not play football in 2010. He knows that people are questioning him, wondering about him. He's got to be fired up to prove himself on the field and off the field. When good people screw up, they use the adversity in a way that makes them better. Quinn looks like he can be that kind of man. And if so, the Rams will benefit from his hunger for redemption.

My mother not only spoke about the sewer workers; she maintained contact with the Socha and Wroblewski families, and would have done the same with Kowalow had he not disappeared after the war. As a boy I watched her meticulously prepare parcels of clothing for the two families living in Soviet-occupied Poland. Her boundless gratitude impelled her to travel to Jerusalem in 1977 to provide the sole testimony that led to Socha and Wroblewski and their wives being named "Righteous Among the Nations," enabling their families to receive monthly stipends. And in 1981, a year before her death, my mother dedicated a Garden of the Righteous Gentiles in Wilmington, with two of its trees planted in memory of Socha and Wroblewski, the first memorial in the United States to Christians who saved Jews.
On the second question, Mr. Schurick's attorney, Dwight Pettit, has sought to persuade the jury that the intent was not to keep voters home but to act as a counter-intuitive spur for potential Ehrlich voters to head to the polls. Circuit Judge Lawrence P. Fletcher-Hill has made his opinion clear: "The message, in the court's judgment, is plainly fraudulent," he said, adding that it was "an attempt to try to get people to stay home." What the jury will conclude remains to be seen.

It does investigate complaints that fall within its jurisdiction, and if those show that a law governing the practice of medicine was broken, the board typically sends the doctor a citation letter, explaining that it intends to take disciplinary action. If the doctor requests a hearing, an assistant attorney general presents the board's allegations and the doctor presents his or her case. Then a hearing examiner -- who is a lawyer -- prepares a summary and analysis of the evidence and sends it to the doctor, who has 10 days to file any objections. The summary and any objections are sent to the board, which then takes action. If no hearing is requested, the board simply reviews the case and takes action.
"I have a lot of friends there, (and) you always wish your friends the best," Richards said while wearing a T-shirt advertising a friend's bar and restaurant in Philadelphia.

We still have a long ways before we can get (to the Stanley Cup finals), but Carts and I, it would have been a little bit awkward if we had to go back there and play the first year back. It would have been a little bit weird."

City officials say they don't have the resources to manage a march that starts in the heart of the Loop during the NATO summit because of the traffic and crowd concerns associated with accommodating the dozens of motorcades that could be moving from downtown hotels to the McCormick Place convention center.

Maybe the national college player of the year will be Kentucky freshman John Wall, who is a one-and-done transient as surely as Texas' Kevin Durant was when he won in 2007.

And the biggest waste of time I've ever discovered—after games (see above)—is the Web. Nothing comes close. It's a total black hole.

Davidson's parents divorced when he was in third grade, and he and his younger brother, Jamie, lived with their mom, Pat. Like her parents, Pat, who died in 2009, encouraged her son's passion for movies by taking him on regular excursions to the Cedar Lee to see independent and foreign films. That passion continued through Davidson's years at Chagrin Falls High School and the University of Virginia. After college in 1997, his graduate school plans were all set: Study filmmaking at Florida State University, then one of the hot film schools. But one day while hanging out in the office of his uncle, Chagrin Falls writer Scott Lax, the phone rang.

Berl is a good man. So firmly are we set behind his eyes that we can't see him from any other perspective, though not everyone in the book sees him this way. His confidence comes not from hubris but rather from his complete lack of self-awareness. Berl doesn't seem to understand the extent to which Tessa has fallen for him. When her life falls to pieces and she is brought into his clinic with a knife she has put in her own stomach, Berl does his very best to fix her. The hospital administration accuses Berl of foul play — people start to look at him funny; old friends don't want to be seen with him. He becomes the stranger (in the sense Camus intended) in his community, but not, to McGuane's credit, to us, his readers.

Whenever a sorcerer enters the scene, or a demon flits across the page, some kind of literary depreciation effect still sets in (though the tide is changing).

Six days after Bridget McCarthy spoke with the police - on May 19, 2004 - Dwyer brought Kevin McCarthy and Denham in to meet with detectives at the Area 3 detective headquarters at Belmont and Western. That's when Kevin McCarthy changed his story, agreeing now that his wife had told the truth in identifying Vanecko and Denham, describing an argument that began when their group had bumped into Koschman and his friends and developed into "pushing, shoving and name-calling" and ended with Koschman on the ground, none of them sure how.

Gessen was finishing the book as protests broke out last fall against election fraud and the cavalier way Prime Minister Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev decided to swap jobs. If her portrait of Putin is correct, he won't easily tolerate the opposition movement that brought tens of thousands to the streets.

Both teams have had terrific leadership in keeping the spirit alive. That's why we've both been able to come from a long ways back."

The wreck appears to have claimed another life today, when the Coast Guard said a middle aged man scuba diving off a charter board died after surfacing with breathing problems.
Driving through the Silver Lake hills to avoid Sunset Boulevard's panicked snarl, I climb along the incline. People are out jogging and walking their dogs, even though fires have moved closer, are no longer a distant TV hell. The higher I climb, the more I see residents take note of my car's make and colour; they mentally record the licence number, but most importantly, my unfamiliar deep-brown face, any distinguishing marks. They look at me as if they will at any moment join together to form a human barricade if I make a wrong or abrupt move. Later, across town, a blond man in the next lane looks over LA pickup casual, then quickly lifts his smoked-glass window.
Bond was reported missing March 31 after he fell into the river at Oregon City. Emergency crews launched an extensive search, but couldn't find him.
It's a nice roster, and it goes 10 players deep. Other than Hibbert, none of them crack the top 10 at their position -- not even Danny Granger, who is having his worst season. But the Pacers will be a tough out, because they excel in the three areas (they rebound, they defend, they shoot 3s) that translate to postseason success.

You also see them advertised on eBay or Craigslist: As I'm writing this, eBay is listing one-day passes for Delta ($14.99 bid) and United ($27.99 "buy it now.")

The 155 CEOs on the Mercury News' annual What the Boss Makes survey (total 2009 compensation: $579 million) can no doubt look ahead to better days. Corporate profits in the valley are up.

But the newspaper's yearly exercise of flipping through the big shots' financials with the help of research firm Equilar got me thinking about the rest of us. What are the rest of us making? How are we doing? What sort of days do we have to look forward to?

But the second night with the dogs, Magie<U+0092>s Lab, Ryder, put his chin on his lap as he moved around in bed. He felt calmed.
"That's because it's not about him," Guthrie continued. "He wasn't famous during his lifetime. He wasn't a celebrity. There have always been people who have said things like, 'Wasn't this land made for you and me?' He was just the one to put it in a word, in a phrase, in a verse. He caught it. I don't think any of those things will ever change. It's what people are asking around the country, and asking around the world, from the first tribe to the last tribe."
"He has 10 blocks here, but I'd be curious to know ho many (shots) he probably changed. He changed a gazillion shots in the paint, and that's what Denver is very good at, getting that ball in the paint, drive and finishing at the rim and getting a lot of layups.

The council's decision won't affect the upcoming summer season, Johnson said.

A: Yes. Take pictures of your car before and after your rental and keep them at least six months. The systems used to determine who damaged a rental are far from perfect. At least one company, Hertz, has pledged to begin photographing all of its cars before they leave the lot. The rest have less scientific ways of determining who is responsible for the dings, dents and scratches. If I didn't know any better, I'd say they try to guess who might have done it.
City Attorney David DeBerry said at Tuesday night's council meeting that the current laws took months to craft, and any changes or additions could take up to three months.
More crucially, it lacks suspense; it's pretty clear early on what's happening at a remote research site, so the film quickly becomes an exercise in guessing who the next person to meet his or her gruesome fate will be. (Hint: Most. It's like a bad version of "Hamlet" in fur parkas.)
Retired Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Bob Walker, who is chairing Gingrich's presidential campaign, describes his candidate as a tough leader who passed entitlement reform, adopted legislation that created millions of jobs and substantially reformed the House of Representatives.
Another factor may be stricter parental attitudes. In September, the journal Pediatrics published a widely circulated study linking shows like "SpongeBob" to kids' poor performance on tests of skills such as following rules. And some parents say they don't let their kids watch the show. Ian Guarnieri of Maplewood, N.J., says he started letting his son watch the show when he was five years old, but quickly pulled the plug. "Once we started to watch it, we decided it wasn't something we wanted him to be watching. It's very low brow."
GM Chris Antonetti said he initially talked to Scott Boras, Damon's agent, before the start of spring training. Once spring training started, Antonetti said he looked to improve the Indians through trades. Toward the end of camp, Antonetti turned his attention back to free agents such as Damon.

Severe weather is limited to the corners of the country the next few days. It is first in the south-southeastern part of Texas today, from around Houston and Austin down to Brownsville. Saturday, the threat is in Florida, from Orlando and Tampa down to Miami. Two inches of rain is possible over much of the Sunshine State this weekend. Low pressure dominates the East Coast with 2-4 inches of rain this weekend, but most of that area is in a drought, if you want to look at it with the rain gauge half-full.

Morales said only $81 million had been invested in Bolivia's power grid since it was privatized in 1997.
A simple Google search for Retriever Towing pulls up a surprising number of results that bring into question both the ethics and integrity of the company and Mr. Coe. Combined with his dismissive response to a story reported by KOIN-TV (6) of Portland resident Ashley Holmquist's legally parked car being towed on Christmas with no refund provided by Retriever Towing, it's difficult to take his candidacy seriously. If he's not willing to be upfront about his dealings in the private sector, why should we as voters expect anything different from him if he were an elected official?

A lot goes into the making of one, for sure, be it a book, a record, a movie or any other form of pop culture: talent, hard work, savvy marketing and, for better or worse, luck. Books and movies about a dystopian near future in which young people -- and children! -- fight to the death in a glorified reality show at the behest of a totalitarian government? That's kind of a tough sell, in theory. It's not Dr. Seuss, certainly.

They also said the petition sections substantially comply with Colorado Election Code, and that Weissmann's constitutional right to run for office — and voters' right to participate by signing a petition — should not be hampered by technical or statutory provisions, particularly if they were honest mistakes that weren't made in an attempt to defraud.
Sen. Bill Baroni (R-Mercer) asked Albin about a recent court decision that threw out municipal laws preventing sex offenders from living near schools and daycare centers.

The Cleveland Democrat, who under a new congressional map saw large portions of his West Side district consolidated with turf represented by Toledo Democrat Marcy Kaptur, filed to run in the new, Lake Erie-hugging district.
TRENTON — Traveling on a bus for six hours is pretty boring. Sitting on a bus after playing a morning baseball game after playing a night game can be exhausting. And having too much time to think about your .193 batting average, your 0-for-4 game that included two strikeouts and hitting into a double play — well, that can be downright depressing.

But he also has shaped not only the way films are made, but how they're released and distributed. "Jaws," a summer movie about a shark terrorizing a beach, was the first film to have what's known as "wide" distribution -- that is, it opened all over the country on the same day, as opposed to rolling out from city to city over time. And its stunning success turned summer from a movie wasteland to prime time for blockbusters. For this he receives both credit and a surprising amount of blame.

Neil Walker chopped a groundball to first baseman Albert Pujols. Pujols made a flip to the bag that Suppan didn't handle. The error was charged to the receiver not the thrower.

øThe camera has a full-size APS-C sensor - the same size as you'd find on a digital SLR such as the Canon Rebel T3i or Nikon D5000 - in a subcompact body that could easily fit in your pocket. It does this by ditching the mirror and viewfinder. All the composition is on the 3-inch LCD on the back of the camera. The NX200 has a huge 20-megapixel image sensor, and you won't have to worry about shutter lag - you can shoot seven frames per second.
Geiger says the Russian government has committed $4 billion to the foundation.

Recent development can have a lot to do with it.
After the speed horses lose steam, here come the stalkers. This is where Union Rags(9-2) could shine. The hype was Macy's balloon-sized for this horse, who was undefeated as a 2-year-old until the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, where he came in second. The can't-get-around-it question is his performance in the Florida Derby: He met with congestion, resulting in a third-place finish. If he's such a champion, why couldn't he at least push up to second?
"We know the sand is going to move around," Miller said. "It's a question of how fast, and where it goes."

A: I think the Heat will use a center in name only, for nominal minutes, to perhaps open minutes for another perimeter player, perhaps Norris Cole, perhaps James Jones, depending on what is needed. Still, I wouldn't rule out Joel Anthony as being a playoff defensive factor.
Mullen is seeking to build name recognition through extensive travel throughout the district and with a major mailing of a color brochure to a targeted list of voters in all the counties.

Enoteca La Storia, 416 N. Santa Cruz Ave., Los Gatos. "By far, my favorite place to get a glass of wine in Los Gatos. On a Friday, I'll go with my girlfriends and get a glass there. It's very European and dark and super-crowded, so it feels hip and lively and very Italian."
Love, love, love that award-winning Nathan.
There are two main problems with an abrupt shift of these costs to the locals, and Mr. O'Malley seeks to address both. The first is that transferring costs from one level of government to another doesn't inherently solve anything — after all, the taxpayers are ultimately on the hook either way — and the second is that some local governments, Baltimore City's in particular, are more strapped than others.
The group acts as a charitable clearinghouse, matching city residents with government services such as free financial counseling, mentoring programs for fathers, and food, clothing and toy drives.

"I talk to Chris a lot," Weber said. "Obviously the last couple of years they have struggled. He's had an unbelievable run. ... That mid-major level, I always told people down there they had better appreciate it because it's hard to really maintain. He just hit some struggles. I know he's a good coach. He was coach of the year. He got a lot out of his kids. He's a good person and a great coach."

An opening-night audience of almost 8,000 got both points, thanks to Zakrin and company. As Elle Woods, a California sorority girl who finds out that she's also a capable high-achiever, Zakrin dances with zest. She also leads the ensemble in one of the strangest, funniest numbers outside of "The Producers," "There! Right There!" (better known, perhaps, by the question that it asks, "Gay? Or European?")
"We're past that point," Aldridge said. "For me, it's not about talking. You can challenge guys. You can talk. But we're past that. We're below .500, we've been blown out two or three times this year -- twice on national television. Challenging guys isn't going to do anything. It's guys taking ownership. And it's all of us taking ownership on our situation and playing better."

Many in Japan believe the bombing was unnecessary, that Japan was already close to losing the war.
Some of my favorite Beard 2012 moments were when:
Mr. Lavicka was vocal and determined, but not loud in his opposition to efforts to tear down the city's heritage. He'd show up at public events then-Mayor Richard M. Daley attended and urge him to save this or that building - or to create more park space. And sometimes Daley would stop and talk to Mr. Lavicka, even inviting him to chat in his limousine, Amber Lavicka recalled.
It was only a happy accident — a college friend asked him to write a musical — that brought him back to music. The resulting show, "Straight Man," which drew acclaim at a Kennedy Center conference, helped cement a relationship with the theater that had led most recently to his music and lyrics for "February House," about a Brooklyn brownstone where several important artists lived communally in the '40s; the show is now at New York's Public Theater.

"And when you're fat, at least in my family, you're not cute or you're not beautiful. So for the longest time, I equated being beautiful with being thin. And because I wasn't thin, I wasn't beautiful. It took a long time for me to disconnect the two. That you can be beautiful and glamorous and -- oh, yes, God, even sexy -- without being small."

If you can't bear to come to Healdsburg and skip the wine tasting entirely, treat yourself to Seghesio's Family Table. Instead of doing your tasting standing at the bar, you can do it seated at a table in a private room and accompanied by a sampling of Seghesio family recipes. Ed's Eggplant alla Parmigiana. Peter's Penne Pasta. Rachel Ann's Spring Risotto. And with any luck, while you're enjoying Rachel Ann's risotto, Rachel Ann herself (a second-generation member of this now six-generation wine family) will come by and fill you in on a little local winemaking history.
In an interview with Anderson Cooper that aired Friday on the syndicated talk show "Anderson," Fratto was asked why she hit Costanzo with a shovel.

The five days of South by Southwest offered overwhelming evidence of a musical explosion blowing in countless directions, without any uniformity or common aesthetic, ranging from hard-core punk to country twang, from dry, deliberate synth pop to a wildly enthusiastic hip-hop contingent, from jangly guitar bands mimicking the sounds of 1965 to aggressive new dubstep. Each sound has its little tribe, each insular community its own brand of superstar, but few of these mini-stars seem able to break into mass consciousness.
I never thought to ask my mom if the recipe had actually changed since that day. Maybe my great-grandmother was as bad as I am at knowing when it feels right, and I have the excuse of genetics.
European markets rose after a report showed unexpected growth in the 16-nation group that uses the euro.

Staton: "At this point, I can't comment on that. There's been no indication with regards to the particular family issues, that is a personal issue I believe that you would have to contact the parties of the family and obtain that information through them.

"I take a risk" every day, says Kelly Rudnicki of sending her 9-year-old son, John, to school. He is allergic to dairy, peanuts, tree nuts and legumes. When John started preschool, Ms. Rudnicki says she got "deer-in-headlights looks" from other parents and teachers because her son was the only child with allergies. Now, people are more conscious, she says. John's fourth-grade class in a suburb of Chicago recently invited Ms. Rudnicki to consult with the planning committee for a spring fair to help select refreshments that won't trigger John's allergies.

Outlook: While Vikings are fully engaged in rebuilding mode, Frazier will need more wins to keep job. Good news for everyone in organization is they have 10 picks, starting with third overall where Kalil is slam-dunk choice -- unless GM Rick Spielman, running draft with full authority for first time -- is enticed to move down for more picks. Vikings could look to WR Justin Blackmon or CB Morris Claiborne to fill holes. Vikings currently have first crack at best non-quarterback.

Whether the path to the nomination ultimately leads through Missouri remains unclear. It will largely depend on what happens on March 6 - "Super Tuesday" - when 10 states weigh in on the Republican candidates for president. If Romney performs especially well on Super Tuesday, the likelihood of a meaningful Missouri caucus could be greatly diminished.

I'll break down the particulars below, but it's likely the Lakers will let down their guard tonight in Game 2. The reasons go beyond the inevitable adjustments from a playoff series. The Lakers have followed many signature wins, including ones against the Clippers, Celtics, Heat and Spurs, with clunkers. The Lakers may say the mind-set changes when the playoffs hit. But it's possible they believe Denver has no chance of beating them. Hence, the possible letdown.

Obama is right that "no magic bullet" can kill high gas prices. It's true that day-to-day swings in gas costs are beyond the control of any president. But Americans find other Obama remarks hard to swallow. For example, his assertion that drilling for more U.S. oil won't lower prices. Americans understand a basic law of economics: more supply of a product usually means lower prices.
The public hospital designation was chosen because Foundation Harmony "believed this selection was the most accurate description of its intended future services," Gaburo said.

We got home 20 minutes late, which made my dad really mad because he said he was starting to get worried. When he asked why we were late, my friend just stood there and didn't say anything. So I just said that we had to stop and get gas and that we misjudged the time. My dad didn't really believe me and grounded me for the next two weeks.

Bill Maher's tweet mocking Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow's faith might be rebounding. Although the "Real Time With Bill Maher" host would not be the first celebrity to poke fun at the outspokenly religious Tebow, his comment on Twitter after the Broncos lost to the Buffalo Bills this weekend -- "Wow, Jesus just f----- #TimTebow bad! And on Xmas Eve! Somewhere in hell Satan is tebowing, saying to Hitler 'Hey, Buffalo’s killing them'" -- is gaining attention for perhaps being the crudest.

I think everyone assumes I'm taken again in the sequel, but what I can tell you is it's not a coincidental abduction. It's fueled by a personal vendetta. We're talking blood feud.

Actually, what was probably the most brazen example of mass voting corruption in the United States erupted not in Cleveland, Columbus or Dayton, but 101 years ago in Ohio's then-as-now rural Adams County, along the Ohio River. Almost 1,700 Adams County voters lost the right to vote, at least for a while, because they'd sold their votes to the highest bidder; prices ranged from a drink of whiskey to $25. (Both parties trafficked in voters, incidentally.)

Payne, who represented the 10th Congressional District, announced less than a month ago that he was being treated for cancer.

Brown, whose solo career was the most successful, remains the most charismatic member of the group. But he's not the best singer among them, and he's certainly not the most skillful dancer -- a fact alluded to during a mid-show bit where Brown pretended to struggle to keep up with the dance routines. Tresvant, who, at 43, still sounds remarkably like the young Michael Jackson, sang lead on much of the early material. Gill, who effectively replaced Brown in New Edition in the late eighties, was in terrific voice at NJPAC; "In The Mood," a brand new seduction anthem that featured his gospel-trained singing, was a concert highlight.

"It's a culture shock. He's away from his family, his fiance and his baby," Portland coach John Spencer said. "We need to try and get him acclimated, which he has done well. There's going to be a breaking-in period where it's unsettling for him. But I truly believe he has the ability to be a leading goal-scorer in this league."
He definitely has a chip on his shoulder, and he seems to be gauging the media cautiously. But he never dodges a question, giving a high-energy, quick-talking, answer. It’s much like his play on the court: fast, aggressive, and seemingly out to prove naysayers.

It's not a stretch to say that at times, Van Der Beek is hilarious in this role, especially in later episodes. (The pilot, while very good, was my least favorite of the three episodes I watched.)
Not everything was perfect: While the meaty red sauce and the ricotta filling were fine, the pasta was bland. The kitchen seemed to have forgotten to put salt in the water. The Caesar ($8.50) was fine, though I wouldn't rank it among the best. This dish is also part of the "Deficit Buster Dinner" where diners can get the salad or split pea soup along with a steak, including a 12-ounce New York, an 8-ounce filet mignon, boneless rib-eye or rack of lamb; there's also a choice of dessert ($38).

The way smart grid works is that the system takes several snapshots a minute of the amount of power being used in a home at any given time. That information is transmitted wirelessly to a device resembling a thermostat inside the house, which immediately would tell the consumer how much power is being used, at what rate and whether the city is in a peak period.

In fact, when he was named one of the top 10 NBA coaches of the first 50 years, he was asked what jacket he wanted, green on white or white on green, for the Celtics.
You are a Mets fan. You wear your old-school cap (the one with the blue button on the top, not orange) even though you know the moment people see you they will ask, “Why do you do this to yourself?” And if you are less than a committed Mets fan -- and there aren’t many these days (the fence sitters are mostly with the Yankees or with the MLB TV package darlings-of-the-week) -- then you shrug your shoulders and don’t say anything, or you join right along and bash for bashing’s sake.
"The folks from 2006 looked at the 1997 example and didn't want to repeat that history,'' he said.
"It's not a recognized car manufacturer, and they have rules that require that people can't just randomly go into key businesses," Wale said. "They have to get approval so that they don't end up with too many suppliers, too many people trying to compete in each industry. It's not a specific issue associated with Tengzhong or Hummer. It's just a structural management of their economy."

And how can we trust him to build a new infrastructure bank when we see how much more his health care bill is going to cost us than he said it would? The president had no qualms about lifting the ceiling on the amount of bad debt Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could absorb and pass on to taxpayers, so how can we trust him to have the taxpayers' backs when he sets up this new agency?
"I've got 100 percent confidence, as does Paul, in the team that we have here that's being led by Chad Buchanan ..." Miller said. "I don't think (Cho's firing) sets us back. We've got a solid team of people out there with Chad leading the charge. I think we'll be able to maintain and then continue to move forward. The goal is to bring someone in here who can take us to that next level. That's Paul's goal, that's my goal and that's really what we're trying to do."
And his voice trailed off. He didn't even have words to finish.
But if you love to taste and compare, evaluate and note, discuss and debate, Noir's wine flights cover the basics. A trio of Syrahs from California, Australia and France or three Valpolicellas from the Veneto, perhaps? Another option is to construct your own flight from the more than 50 wines by the glass on offer, from a simple glass of Lake County Sauvignon or Italian Pinot Grigio to a Kosta Brown Pinot Noir that goes for $27 a glass.

The sophomore remembers standing at the bus stop after school let out. He said hello to a friend, then put on his earphones. He was listening to a song by a rapper named the Game when it happened.
Pinker says one of the main reasons for the drop in violence is that we are smarter. IQ tests show that the average teenager is smarter with each generation. The tests are constantly adjusted to keep the average at 100, and a teenager who now would score a 100 would have scored a 118 in 1950 and a 130 in 1910. So this year's average kid would have been a near-genius a century ago. And that increase in intelligence translates into a kinder, gentler world, Pinker says.

“We haven’t been paying attention to the issues that made independent women feel negatively about Gov.

Perhaps the best hope for Indy's neighborhoods is to dramatically improve families' educational options. Stronger charter and private schools certainly help, but the city needs a healthy, attractive public school system at its center if the steady flight to suburban districts is to stop.

Four bishops have resigned in response to the probes, but others implicated in cover-ups have refused with the Vatican's backing.

One is Apple's policy of hoarding the cash it makes, like a dragon resting on a pile of gold. It doesn't share any with investors through dividends or buybacks, like many other companies do. The policy is all the more striking when you consider the size of the cash pile: $97.6 billion. That's enough for a $100 special dividend for every Apple share.

3. Metta World Peace's good defense canceled out his bad offense. OK, so it was cute to see his two three-pointers cut the Thunder lead to 96-87 with 2:25 left. But World Peace hardly should've been featured as much offensively where he went three-of-13 from the field. It's a shame because World Peace mostly played solid defense on Durant, who had to work hard for his 21 points on 10-of-21 shooting. World Peace made him pick up his dribble, fronted him in the post and aggressively fought through screens. It was all for naught because of World Peace's bad shooting.

The goal of the crew is to get the players in and out of the set as quickly as possible. Holliday breezed through his spot. Freese's group with the confetti nailed a couple of the segments with one take. Schumaker's took a little bit longer because who puts on a jousting gauntlet with a straight face on the first try?

Judged by the headlines per capita generated, you'd have to go with the Boston Red Sox. We all know what Stephen King's next book will be: "Full Dark, No Stars -- at Fenway." But from a baseball view, I think the Braves plummet has been far more surprising and damning for that organization. We all know the big number. A month ago, the Braves had a 10 1/2-game lead in the wild card and they were widely considered the second-base team in the National League, ahead of the Milwaukee Brewers and whoever the NL West had to offer. Atlanta was a worthy challenger to the league's Goliath, the Philadelphia Phillies. My, how things have changed. The Braves' pitching has ruptured, their brilliant young relievers have faded with fatigue and overuse, and the offense has vanished. The Red Sox lost their lead to the Tampa Bay Rays, a team good enough to win either of the other AL divisions and contend for three of the playoff berths available in the NL.

My first job was at McDonald's in North Olmsted on Lorain Road. I was 16, and would go to work sometimes after my cheerleading practice.

We adopted a puppy last year, and ever since we brought him home, he has been nipping and biting. We met with a woman who trains dogs, and she said it could be an issue. She advised us to pinch his lips against his teeth as soon as he nips to show that it hurts. It doesn't faze him at all. He jumps up on us, lunges at us and bites. He is a good dog otherwise.

It was a fantastic way to grow up. The only negative about that was that we were not educated in sun protection. We all thought being in the sun was very healthy. If you had a cold the word was, "get out in the sun and get some vitamin C." If you were tan it was considered "healthy looking." We were completely unaware of the dangers of constant exposure to the sun.
Fair or not, this view of the administration is problematic, politically, with lots of voters. According to several polls, a majority of Americans support the Arizona law. In a recent Quinnipiac poll, 62% of respondents said the Supreme Court should uphold the Arizona law, and 27% wanted it struck down. Interestingly, 45% of Latino respondents wanted the court to uphold the Arizona law, while 43% hoped it would be overturned.

So let's start in familiar territory. The popular tzatziki, known in Turkey as cacik (pronounced jajk, more or less), calls for little more than cucumbers, garlic and yogurt. Success is in the details. The cucumber should be firm, not bitter and contain relatively few seeds. Farmers' markets and specialty produce stores are the best source for the 5- to 6-inch Mediterranean cucumbers -- not the smaller Kirby, or pickling, cucumbers -- and crisp Armenian cucumbers that work well in this salad.

Like any person on the street might, the pediatrician believed these hefty kids simply needed to stop gorging themselves on fried foods and sweets. He had yet to grasp the big picture.
The 4 percent limit was imposed in 2007 by then-Gov. Jon Corzine and the Legislature, which allowed temporary exemptions for scheduled pension payments and pay raises in existing contracts. Other items, such as health care costs and debt payments, were permanently outside the limit. Where the state’s judgment comes in is deciding whether "extraordinary" circumstances — like skyrocketing energy costs or opening a new school — qualify for a waiver. And while school districts have to fit within specific categories of need, towns can also claim any purpose that is "essential to protect or promote the public health, safety or welfare."
But is that the right message to send to kids -- that it's OK to skip out on a debt? Or, despite their age, should they be held to a more businesslike standard?

Keeping it clean
A 104-minute rain delay threw off both teams' timing for the game, and that's what brought Cubs starter Jeff Samardzija to the dugout and kept him there as he wondered when to stop watching the Cardinals' pageantry and start warming up. Other players, Sveum said, were sick of the clubhouse or had their timing "goofed up" by the length of the pre-game introductions.
One thing is certain about Tuesday's game: Joel Przybilla will not make his season debut, despite the fact that he and McMillan expressed hope last week that would occur.
Reyes was an anchor and three-year starter on the Huskies' defensive front.

Among his 46 tackles, Reyes had 4.5 sacks and 13.5 tackles for loss. Twenty-four of the tackles were solo.

Other cities -- including Atlanta, Honolulu and Seattle -- required to limit sewage spills have now surpassed Portland in cost to customers.

Once upon a time, many university officials thought gambling ads were at odds with their mission of educating young people. As recently as 2004, a Pac-10 official said the conference discouraged schools from accepting sponsorships from gambling interests, and the NCAA's former gambling-issues officer said many schools turned down such offers.

The suspension is well-tuned to the car's weight. Body roll is controlled and the ride is sporty, but comfortable. The electro-hydraulic steering is nicely weighted and relays some feedback from the road but it could be more direct. The brakes are plenty firm, yet Fisker has done a nice job of modulating how touchy they can be. Some regenerative brake systems on more mainstream, mass-produced cars get a bit too eager.

Barbara's Bookstore in the heart of the University of Illinois at Chicago is easily identifiable by the window drawings of authors and their quotes about reading. It caters to UIC students with comfy couches, tables and a big bargain section. Barbara's is an independent chain with six Chicago-area locations, plus six in O'Hare International Airport and one in Boston. It has the heart of an indie store but the capabilities of a chain; employees can find a book at another store for patrons to purchase the same day, for example.

The usual presumption is that people know what's good for them, and that they're better off if you allow them to spend their money on whatever they personally value the most. While that may be the right perspective for most purchases, I don't think it's a good way to think about lottery tickets. For many people, gambling may be just another form of entertainment. But for others it is a very destructive compulsion. And although you could argue that we need the tax revenue, the burden of this tax falls disproportionately on lower-income households. I do not think the quality of life in California has improved with the increased prevalence of gambling.

Take, for example, the figure of a mounted, armored knight with an angry stare atop a 27-foot-tall pedestal in Newark’s Lincoln Park. Art historians would recognize it immediately: It is a replica of the Bartolomeo Colleoni monument in Venice, Italy, dedicated to a Renaissance condotierre (mercenary) who left 260,000 gold ducats to the republic if its leaders would erect an equestrian statue in his honor. Since equestrian statues, even in bronze, cost much, much less than that, the Venetians, predictably, agreed.

Allison may be, behind her façade of professional accomplishment, one more child about to have a child, but having her child is a given; she never considers abortion as an option. (The birth scene is both stirring and shocking.) Ben may be, behind his slob exterior, a hapless boor and a quintessential slacker -- he and his goony buddies are trying, in their cyberspace-cadet fashion, to put together a soft-core Web site -- but he's also tender, gentle, and vulnerable, an overgrown, under socialized boy with a touching potential for commitment and growth.

Turns out that when you go to a Las Vegas Bowl (and not a Rose Bowl) and don’t have a high-profile sneaker donor backing you, that most of us are not interested in the news unless its big stuff.

Others feel that Leyland owed it to Verlander to keep him out there so he could somehow slay the ninth-inning beasts that are wreaking havoc with his mental well-being. Both sides are way too extreme of course.

Did it have meaning? It's silly to think it didn't. Miami has been playing poorly of late, and if you didn't think the Heat was in need of a victory here, its tenacity should have told you otherwise. If it weren't a big game, LeBron James wouldn't have been playing with extra ferocity.

He did conjure some revealing scenes, none better than the one of him watching Neil Armstrong's landing on the moon on a tiny TV. Shatner was divorced and lonely at the time. His musing on Capt.

Had the show ventured farther and deeper into such realms, "Shatner's World" might have been a much worthier voyage

Architect Haralamb Georgescu (1908-77) designed dozens of buildings in Southern California, but he never gained the same level of fame as his midcentury contemporaries -- at least not here. Before he fled Communist rule in Romania and immigrated to the U.S. in 1947, Georgescu had a successful career in his native country; today many of his modernist buildings in Bucharest are landmarks, and the architect is considered one of Romania's most important. An exhibit last summer at the University of Architecture and Urbanism in Bucharest honored Georgescu and included a symposium on his work that included Wim de Wit, curator of architectural collections at the Getty Research Institute. An architecture museum under construction in Bucharest is to be co-named after Georgescu and Frank Lloyd Wright.

"I said that we admire all their progress, we admire their economy -- unfortunately we still have Buddhist monks, Tibetans, burning themselves to death, Nobel prize winners under house arrest, and I said I do not understand why you continue to prop up North Korea, which is a threat to the security of the world, and I want to know why you vetoed the resolution on Syria at the U.N.

Reasons for optimism: Thomas, who has changed his jersey number from 1 to 5, had arguably the best season ever for a Ducks quarterback in 2010. And he did it as a sophomore. Thomas combined the passing prowess of the Ducks' first spread-option quarterback, Kellen Clemens, with occasional slipperiness in the fashion of Dennis Dixon and Jeremiah Masoli. The results were 2,881 yards passing and 30 touchdowns with just nine interceptions to go along with 486 yards with five scores. What made Thomas' performance even more impressive was that he made key throws in the face of heavy pressure and while taking hits. "I think the one thing that I remarked and I said it a lot last year is that it almost seemed like every week he just got better and better," Oregon coach Chip Kelly said. "There are new facets to his game that he continues to work on."

The first summer I was here, I and my neighbors woke up to find windows shot out of our cars parked on the street. A block and a half away, it was spray-painted in the middle of the street, "Dis my hood white people." That was the thing that first made me aware of how unawarely I had bought this condo. But I was shocked because I have all of this experience in dialogues on race, and I thought I knew a lot about the dynamic.

Knight's little performance in her uncle's bar wasn't her first, she recalled during a 2008 conversation. She earlier performed on television's predecessor to "Star Search" and "American Idol."
The deadlock over disclosure marks an ironic twist for the agency, considering its history. The downfall of President Nixon revealed not just political dirty tricks but also how the flow of secret cash had bought favors in Washington. In 1974, a reform-minded Congress adopted strict limits on the funding of campaigns, along with disclosure requirements. Congress created the FEC to enforce the new law.
Blues got off to a sluggish start, but have been coming on in the second half of the period. The goal is the third for Backes' in two games and seventh of season.
My favorite hot appetizer is yose dofu ($16), a fresh tofu made tableside and served with a dipping sauce with fresh wasabi and green onions, and a mushroom sauce. Although the soups may lack the splash of other dishes, both the ramen ($14) - Morimoto's version of chicken noodle soup - and the duck meatball soup ($14) with a rich stock and mountain potato, are superb.

It is a racist, pointless and misogynistic rendering.
As for their other moves, it looks like they got a lot of protection around Tannehill. Is Martin playing left tackle? Isn’t that where Pro Bowler Jake Long plays? Who’s moving to the right, where all the holes on the Dolphins line exist? Or might someone be moving out of Miami?

Sadly this is place is out of business and decrepit. Pity. The pool with its islands was so fun to swim in, and the bar used to be the favorite of folks like former Buc Mike Alstott. Let's hope someone sees the potential in this place and gets it back to bar-hopping glory.

The nutritional guidelines for the National School Lunch Program hadn't been updated in 15 years. During that time, obesity rates among children skyrocketed. A full one-third of American children are either overweight or obese, with rates of diabetes and other health-related issues also showing dangerous increases. Children receive about 40 percent of their daily calories from school lunches, so there is a connection.

I'm with Daley on the fee, but disagree that it's just a food festival. Actually, I'm guessing the mayor would articulate a defense similar to mine on the positives the Taste offers. I worry his successor will come along and think it is just food and start chipping away at something really special.
With his subsequent crimes, Johnson proved he couldn't be trusted, Jensen said.
Meanwhile, midfielder Sal Zizzo was jogging with Nagbe around the playing field during the game.

Still: It’ll matter to Calipari’s legacy if he loses this game, with a heavily favored team, to Louisville and Pitino, the former Wildcats coach. As satisfying as a victory will be for the winner, a loss would be 10 times as devastating for the loser. That’s just how it is for a rivalry like this.

On the other side of the coin, while Oregon has abysmal statistics related to hunger, homelessness and poverty, we have an inspirational network of organizations that are addressing those issues and this is one of them. I feel really driven by people who are passionate and deeply committed.

Obama has long expressed a complicated view of national security, but it was initially obscured by his strong opposition to the Iraq war. Less widely noticed was his attempt to balance that with vows to send more troops to Afghanistan and unilaterally strike inside Pakistan if necessary to capture or kill Bin Laden. At the time, many analysts thought those positions were more about avoiding the historic trap that past anti-war Democrats had fallen into. But four years later, Obama has presided over a policy that has married elements of both parties.

Potenza is a Midwesterner by background, a surgeon by profession. He worked around the clock treating burn victims last October, stopping only to evacuate his own house, which was under threat from a second fire. He speaks carefully, knowing that illegal immigration is a politically charged issue. An estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States, and their health emergencies pose a burden to hospitals. He knows many people were enraged that the victims were treated rather than deported. "Their injuries give them something of a pass," he said. "But it's a huge price to pay."

They already know that salt receptors are more complicated than sugar receptors, which work like a simple lock-and-key system. They also know that salt receptors take the form of pore-like channels in cell membranes through which only sodium can sneak to send the pure, clean taste of salt to the brain. A lot of different receptors and other molecules appear to be involved, and much is still unknown.

Ms. Newhouse has visited every building she writes about, attending multiple performances and interviewing architects, acousticians, managers and users. What concerns her most is the connection between the visual and the aural, the relationship of the art of design to the act of listening, a synthesis that can take us into the sublime, one of the most complex and powerful experiences that architecture can provide. (And please, let's get rid of that old chestnut about architecture being frozen music, which is just as ridiculous as music being melted architecture, which fortunately no one has suggested yet.)

Although Israeli officials now believe Assad's days are numbered, they say they are keeping their distance from the key players in Syria. They do not want to be seen as intervening in Syrian affairs.

When I tell her this, I am met with anger. I've tried inviting her over to my apartment instead, but she doesn't like it there because it's too small. She also gets upset when I have plans with other friends or my boyfriend, arguing that I can see them anytime I want, and this makes me feel guilty.

West 25th is luring some retailers away from other up-and-coming Cleveland neighborhoods. Since opening on Detroit Avenue in late 2007, Room Service has become known for eclectic products and DeBoe's ever-growing "Made in the 216" sales of local merchandise. As the store outgrew its 650 square feet, DeBoe could not find the perfect space nearby.

The Huskies were ranked No. 20 nationally and fifth in the Pac-12 by Rivals.com and 22nd nationally and fifth in the conference by Scout.com.

Going overboard with heat, as we detailed months ago in our review of the excellent Shoki Ramen House, can overwhelm the palate, deaden the taste buds and diminish the overall experience. I witnessed a man at Shoki practically melt away, beads of sweat forming over his brow, as a bowl of super-spicy broth got the best of him. The advice here is simple: Know your tolerance for heat, then go up in small increments if you feel adventurous.

2. Draft Kalil: Heckert threw USC offensive tackle Matt Kalil into the mix last week as a possible option if he is available to the Browns at No. 4. But Kalil would be the starting right tackle for the Browns, who are set at left tackle with Joe Thomas, and No. 4 seems high to draft a player at that position. More than likely the Browns would either pass on Kalil or try to trade down a few spots.

"If the market does recover and prices start to rise, we feel better knowing we’re buying into strength at the expense of higher interest rates or paying more for a home.

"First time Schmidt saw the Pinnacles he knew it was the place. Three columns of rock shot up like the tentacles of some ancient creature, weathered feelers probing the sky." By the time the crazed war veteran runs a few tests with an earth meter and a divining rod, he has no doubt that the power is there, running along an ancient fault line. The rock is a natural antenna. In time, as Schmidt surveys that range, he will be rewarded by a vision that approaches one lonely night at astonishing speed: "It was disk-shaped, featureless but for a ring of iridescent lights round the rim, like gem stones or feline eyes. ... It was, he thought, the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen." In short order, this ex-pilot and wife-beater digs a bunker under the rock and transforms himself into "the Guide," the contact for an extraterrestrial power, a spiritual leader with an army of Lightworkers selling his wacky recordings and luring ever more members to his mission.

Lawmakers spent much of the 2011 session trying to build consensus on a major overhaul of the tax code, but were unable to negotiate a deal in the closing hours of the session. The effort faced difficulties, in part because it was based on a plan created by a super committee of business leaders and academics the General Assembly formed the year before. Also, the 2011 effort was launched before Gov. Nathan Deal was elected, giving him little reason to buy into the effort. That will change this year. The governor this week will unveil his own plans for tax reform and Republican leaders are sure to have their own ideas, ranging from eliminating the sales tax manufacturers pay on energy to raising the state sales tax to adding sales tax to groceries.

Mr. city manager, department heads, fire and police, you want to do something for this city to show you care? Stop horsing around and get to the point you all are avoiding.

Your salaries are not recession proof and the draining you've done of our city's reserves to fund your lifestyles over the last four years has been outrageous. How cowardly of you all to let our city unravel when as public employees the solution is right under your noses, in your publicly funded wallets.

The future first lady was born in Ely, Nev., in 1912 and grew up — quickly — in Artesia. At age 13, she lost her mother, which meant added responsibilities at home; five years later, her father died.

We're now in that third phase, with the casino, the medical mart, the Flats East Bank project. We have entrepreneurs investing on East Fourth. We have a new form of county government that's committed to investing their tax windfall from the casino into the urban area. I think that we can thoughtfully make investments as a community that will keep this third phase going, without a decade stop in between. I don't think we can afford another decade, after we get these current investments open, without ongoing investment.

One of the most useful minor changes is the dictation feature that Apple added. It allows you to type email messages, notes or other documents by simply speaking, rather than typing on the device's virtual keyboard. It's similar to the voice-recognition feature in the iPhone 4S, except that the new iPad's version doesn't also include that device's Siri feature. So you can't get directions or tomorrow's weather by simply speaking into the gadget, as you can with the iPhone 4S.

We believe that Dallas Dance is the right choice to lead the Baltimore County public school system, and we eagerly await his coming to Baltimore County and building upon the legacy created by Mr. Hairston. Maryland law specifically entrusts the selection of a superintendent in every county (and Baltimore City) to the local board of education. Our selection was made free of inappropriate outside influences. As your editorial points out, no one in Maryland knew S. Dallas Dance before he was hired. Our decision was based upon the public input received during the process and the collective judgment of the individual members of the board.

Ace the same test on your second try and you can buy your certification. Lesson for consumers: Your personal trainer might not be as qualified as his framed certification suggests.

I took her criticism like I always do, with a smile, and did what I wanted to anyway. And my book got picked up. Caroline's didn't. Not one publisher wanted it. I don't know why. I wish everyone success in all they do, but I can’t help it hers didn’t get published. Go buy blk water! Eat at the Brownstone! Download "On Display"! Buy Fabulicious! I want the best for everyone."

I have agonized over this post. Even if only 9 people read it, at least one of them will think I'm a complete jerk because of what I've written. And, oh, I do so like to be liked. But I am heart sick over the state of the church in the U.S., where as long as you keep "biggering and biggering" you get a pass for whatever you say and do as a pastor.
That's partly why defenders started stepping forward immediately after the scathing report was released. They felt that Farmer, a Republican, was being attacked. Two-time Republican gubernatorial candidate Larry Forgy insisted the review was done for political reasons by a Democratic state auditor.

As a child growing up in small-town Iowa, Rath didn't fit in; when she'd come home after a bad day at school, her mom would say, "Draw me a picture of it."
The conversation Juanita Hall remembers having with her son last summer confused her. For as long as she could recall, Brandon Hall was always No. 10. In football, roller hockey, baseball and certainly basketball. In every level of every league. But here he was, sitting at the kitchen table in July, telling her that he wanted to change his number — his identity — for his senior year at Saint Peter’s College.
More encouraging news followed throughout the day. The Institute of Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity rose in November for the 16th month.

"There's undeniable rage still about how this could happen," Steve Sneiderman told the AJC earlier this week. He lives near his parents in suburban Cleveland, Ohio. "Then there's an almost constant state of disbelief. I'll be driving in the car and I'll hear a song and it just hits me.
"I just cried," she said. "You would never know that you'd get so attached to chickens, but they have their own personalities. It was hard."
Thursday began as one big problem. Rain, a flat tire. Rossman desperately wanted to find a replacement for a broken coupler on his bike, although the mechanic from Sram -- a component company that partners with Rapha -- had rigged a temporary solution.

Even as some friends professed to be shocked by the announcement that Heidi Klum is divorcing Seal (yes, he's the singer in the couple) after seven years, others close to the couple say it was a long time coming.
The social gospel is not new to this president. It is largely a creation of 20th-century Protestants who believed in applying "Christian principles" to rectify society's problems. Deeds quickly supplanted faith, evolving into a "works salvation" theology, which says if you do enough good works, God will be pleased and let you into Heaven when you die. This contradicts biblical teaching that it is by faith and not works that one is saved from judgment (Ephesians 2:8-9). Some verses teach works as an extension of faith, revealing its depth and seriousness, but they equally teach that works without faith in Jesus is not enough. This is traditional Christian theology. Accept it, or not, but the president is mistaken when he interprets Scripture to achieve his political goals.
block without a swimming pool, you'll rarely get back even half of the money you pay to build one, and you can scare prospective buyers off because many don't want the responsibility or liability of a pool. In-ground pools are expensive and can range from less than $20,000 to more than $60,000, depending on how expansive your design and materials.

I used it to create a grape arbor in our backyard. It's gotten to the point where no one who knows me is surprised to see me drive by with a log hanging out the back of my car. In fact, I hauled so many logs -- trees, really -- in our old Honda wagon that an axle eventually broke.
The Hoosiers were the only team to beat Kentucky before Sunday. Also potentially haunting the Wildcats in their bracket is the 20th anniversary of The Shot by Christian Laettner that lifted the Blue Devils over the Wildcats in overtime of the 1992 East Regional finals. Woods’ basket in ’92 gave the Wildcats a one-point lead with 2.1 seconds left that set up the epic finale.
With respect to the line, so many veterans were hurt by the end of the season that four true freshmen were forced to play in their spots in the Champs Sports Bowl. The only truly experienced player on the unit in the final game was senior tackle Zebrie Sanders, who had to showcase a bit of his own versatility during the season. Because of the rash of injuries, the right tackle had to switch to the left side of the line during the season.

Depending on whether it's a weeknight or a weekend, the vibe at this cozy storefront is either soothingly quiet or wildly energetic. Two rows of white-swathed tables fill the small space with room enough for a four-seater bar at the end. A series of posters from the famed Willi's Wine Bar in Paris gives some color to the deep chocolate walls. Dark bentwood chairs complete the classic wine-bar look. What you can't see when you walk in is a side patio trimmed in ornate black ironwork and a spacious back garden. Combined, they more than double the seating.
Braun hit a solo homer into the sand area beyond the fence in right-center — one of the deepest parts of Petco Park — in the fourth and a two-run shot onto the balcony on the fourth level of the Western Metal Supply Co. brick warehouse in the left field corner in the fifth.

It’s not paranoid to think that Cuomo’s plan is to sweep a bad TWU contract under the rug before Lhota is confirmed. The last governor, David Paterson, made sure the old contract was settled via arbitration, so that nobody could be held politically accountable. That contract resulted in three-year raises of twice the inflation rate.
"The Molalla Buckeroo had seven great candidates this year," said Tim Anderson, vice president of the Molalla Buckeroo Executive Committee.

Stack also disputed the argument by Elijah Ford’s attorney, Steven Lember, that the state couldn’t prove his client was anything more than an accomplice.

Los Angeles tacked on two more in the fifth, getting rocket doubles to the gap from Trout and Callaspo to start the inning and chase Pavano, who has been searching for lost velocity all season long. With a fastball that routinely was clocked in the mid-80s, and an unwillingness to pitch inside, the Angels hitters were able to crowd the plate and hammer the outside corners early and often.
The 2003 comeback in Tampa.
But many analysts say the recent data are flawed. They say the data suggest American drivers this year, based on the average of weekly figures, have cut back at the pump by 622,900 barrels a day from a year ago, the equivalent of Argentina's entire daily consumption. The U.S. economy is gaining steam, they argue—nonfarm payrolls rose 1.6% in February—and while high gas prices probably are eroding demand, it wouldn't be by that much.

But, in what has become a common practice for the Blazers during the NBA draft, it was anything but a simple transaction.

Indeed, Boeing is one of a handful of local companies trying to tap this pool of potential workers. It builds two types of fighter jets in St. Louis - highly skilled work. The average age of its assembly workers here is north of 50. Attrition is a challenge, said Al Parker, senior manager of production operations training. But with a little extra work, someone who has spent a decade building cars can be taught to build planes.
Nagourney then quoted the art critic Dave Hickey, who said of PST: "It's corny. It's the sort of thing that Denver would do. They would do Mountain Standard Time. It is '50s boosterish, and I would argue largely unnecessary."
Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex), who will hold a hearing on the $32.7 million NJ Transit cut Thursday, said it “may well equate to a hefty tax increase on lower- and middle-class New Jerseyans who have no other choice but to rely on NJ Transit to get to work.”

But Bartók, to create his effects, divides the orchestra into two camps, facing one another like mirror images. Thursday, one wondered if the string players on one side could hear their counterparts on the other. There was persistent out-of-tuneness and rhythmic imprecision. Even so, Outwater battled on, stirring a mood toward the end, just not enough of it. It was time for "Holy Sisters."

This is set against a backdrop of more obvious political intrigue, with Essex (Sam Reid) and Southampton (Xavier Samuel) plotting a coup that proves disastrous. And there is another subplot involving the bastard children of the "virgin" queen. All of this ties together, sort of, in John Orloff's screenplay, but it's not a neat fit. There is a little too much going on, which means that, for instance, Oxford disappears for large chunks of time.

The missing octopus aside, Kyma delivered quality Greek, one food I can never get enough of. Prices are reasonable; none of those $45 lamb chops you might find elsewhere. The arni paidakia or lamb chops here ($28) are marinated in olive oil, lemon and fresh herbs and served with potatoes sto fourno (garlic lemon potatoes) and tzatziki. You may wish the four chops were bigger or more numerous, but they were expertly cooked (medium rare) and bursting with flavor.

WASHINGTON — People familiar with the investigation tell The Associated Press that the gunman held in the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona and others has been identified as Jared Lee Loughner.
Fred and I have two children, so this has been difficult for all of us. But I'm frustrated with his disrespect for my space and seriously considering divorce. I want to tell him, but I'm worried about his reaction since he cries every time I mention anything that implies that I might "give up on us." He was married once before, and told me that he had to stay with his brother for a while afterward to make sure he wouldn't hurt himself.

Cash-strapped school districts in most states have been looking for federal help, but a bill that might help pay teacher salaries hasn't gained traction in Congress. In Oregon, it's possible that additional federal support for Medicaid -- if it's approved ---- could free up state money that could be shifted to education. State and school leaders say they aren't counting on that relief.

Mr. Djeraouane then opens an ancient door onto a room filled with what look like wooden ship's capstans, draped with heavy ropes tied in seafarer's knots. "In the 19th century, the stagehands were former seamen. This is the original stage machinery they used. It's all still in working order," he says.

For all the problems Iraq faces, it must now stand on its own, and its people should be given the chance to try to make their new yet imperfect democracy work. We can't fight their battles for them anymore, or dictate what kind of society they should build. Our combat role there has ended, even though thousands of U.S. private contractors, aid workers and diplomats will remain in the country to provide economic and technical assistance.

The Grammys, which took place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, attracted 39 million viewers — the second largest audience in its history. (Only the 1984 ceremony was watched more widely). Undoubtedly, the number was boosted by curiosity about how Whitney Houston, who died on Saturday, would be honored and how Adele, who has been battling voice problems in recent months, would sound.
The Occupy Eutaw St. crew still loves the Orioles. They'll go and support the players. They appreciate manager Buck Showalter. Their beef is with Angelos, who they see as having done too little to help the Orioles compete during their decade-plus of inadequacy.
Regarding the haircut, Jenner says: "I think it's still girlie, it's not shaved back and sides like a boy's cut. And who knows, perhaps she cut a chunk out of her own hair and her parents had to cut it shorter to fix it. Children do it all the time."

The politicians who toured the plant -- Branstad, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, Nebraska Lt. Gov. Rick Sheehy and South Dakota Lt. Gov. Matt Michels -- agree with the industry's view that the meat product has been unfairly maligned and mislabeled. They issued a joint statement earlier saying it is safe.

Last week, Tehran circles tipped a “top secret message” from President Obama to Iran’s “Supreme Guide” Ali Khamenei. This week, almost everyone seemed to know (or pretend to know) something about the mystery letter. In an editorial Thursday, the daily Kayhan, published by Khamenei’s office, claimed Obama had adopted “a supplicatory tone, seeking to ingratiate himself in the eyes of the supreme guide.”
"He said he'd never do it again, it was an oversight," Byrne said.
By the time the film hit, Taylor had already married — and divorced — hotel heir Conrad “Nicky” Hilton. (She would wed six more men — one of them twice — before she died.) She was now, clearly, an adult. Yet MGM didn’t know what to do with her, assigning her leads in nothing-much movies (“Love Is Better Than Ever”) or supporting parts in costume epics (“Ivanhoe”).

On a nasty, drizzly Wednesday afternoon I feared something similar would happen while traffic waited for the bridge to reopen. Being stuck in a place where the only exit is blocked made me think that the narrow, old bridge should be replaced with one that is wider, or another span should be added.
The last time he visited family in New Jersey was three years ago, so he wanted this trip to count. Patsay said he is taking two iPads back to Russia when he returns home on Thursday, one for himself and a second for a colleague at the small software company, called Unreal Mojo, which he co-owns.

An important part of any trip is research. What are you and your family looking for in a spring break? Do you want a beach where you and your kids can relax and build sandcastles and swim? Or perhaps camping is more your family's style. Some families love the opportunity to unwind and spend a week with quiet relaxation, while others prefer vacations jam-packed with activity. Fortunately, there is a vacation for everyone.

Haren gave up a single to center by Brett Lawrie on his first pitch of the third, ending a streak of 17 1-3 consecutive hitless innings by Angels pitchers (54 batters) following Weaver's gem and Jerome Williams' complete game shutout in which he no-hit the Twins over the final six. The streak technically began with Williams' inning-ending pickoff of Denard Span.

Find another doctor. (I was tempted to say, "Run for your life!") As warm, charming, caring and attentive as your doctor may be, her poor hygiene is a danger to your health. That she would present herself to patients in the condition you have described and practice such poor hygiene makes me wonder how qualified she is to practice medicine.
"I want them to compete," new CSU coach Jim McElwain said Thursday after the final practice before the spring game. "It's a game. To me, every time they put themselves on film, they're telling a lot about who they are. So what we say on the daily basis is, 'Be proud of what you put on video.' "

I love the feel of Wayfare Tavern. Tyler Florence has stepped out from behind the camera to prove himself a formidable chef. Yet, although I think Wayfare will be a San Francisco favorite for a long time, it's still a work in progress. The interior is wonderful and the food is mostly excellent, but there are a few kinks to work out.
Austerity is intended to address this nervousness by reducing a government's borrowing needs, but there has been a negative side effect: as economic output shrinks, the debt burden actually looks worse.

Odom never seemed happy or comfortable in Dallas, not even when wife and reality TV co-star Khloe Kardashian was in the stands just a few feet from the Mavericks bench. His averages of 6.6 points, 4.2 rebounds and 20.5 minutes were career lows, and he was booed by the home crowd as the sluggish performances multiplied.

I finally leave to search for what I've heard is the only known flushing toilet of ancient Rome. When I first read about it, I didn't understand: Most Roman toilets had water running constantly beneath them. Isn't that flushing? Evidently, no. A real flushing toilet uses one gush of water to wash down the waste.
Susan Sender, chief clinical officer for the Loving Care agency, described how a 9-year-old boy suffered brain damage and lapsed into a coma when his breathing tube became dislodged at school, and his newly assigned nurse was unable to help him in time.

"I feel a bit nostalgic," Stoppard said as he accepted the award, noting that it had been 40 years since "Rosencrantz" opened on Broadway. "It was a different planet in 1967. They had little ashtrays clamped to the backs of the seats, and the author got 10% of the gross."

Tehran investors may be guilty of wishful thinking in their eagerness for an agreement that would ease the economic sanctions squeezing their country. My guess is that they probably have it right. So far, Iran is following the script for a gradual, face-saving exit from a nuclear program that even Russia and China have signaled is too dangerous. The Iranians will bargain up to the edge of the cliff, but they don't seem eager to jump.
Chief prosecution lawyer Shunzo Omuro said it was "illogical" to rule out Ozawa's collusion with the aides while acknowledging his oversight of their actions.
(On if they are going to get one of the guys they have ranked three or four)- "Yeah, it's going to be one of our top guys."
As a black person raised in Baltimore, pit bulls were a central part of the social fabric of my life. The best dog I ever had was a pit bull, and he was the sweetest thing I have ever met. I am confident that if you were to ask the vast majority of pit bull owners in this city, they will tell you the same thing. For black folks like me who grew up with them, we love them because when we were born into a violent world not of our choosing, they protected us, with violence when necessary, but more often they showed the love that let us know they would only use that so called "innate" potential for violence in extreme circumstances.
All in all, the IdeaWorks report confirms two widespread suspicions:
The victim, 23-year-old Jose Luis Ramos Sanchez, may have been the target of a robbery gone wrong, authorities said. Two people were robbed in Plainfield a few hours before the shooting, law enforcement officials said.
Because Nadia Lockyer used to work for the Alameda County District Attorney's Office, that agency handed the case over to state investigators.
Throwing all that info into a centrifuge and hoping to come up with a single, solitary truth is fruitless. The level of impact the teams are receiving from these first-rounders is as varied as when they were selected. Three of the first-rounders identified on teams in the American League West just joined those teams this season - Mike Trout in LA, Dustin Ackley in Seattle and Weeks in Oakland. Like the Cardinals, Texas does not have a homegrown first-rounder to brag on. The Rangers traded a few of them to land Cliff Lee last season for their pennant run. Cleveland pushed itself into contention this season with a team built around trades and other teams' high-end (some first-round) draft picks. There's a low-budget team that hasn't been able to groom from within, and then there's Cleveland's division rival Kansas City that has earned raves for its ability to build a team through a draft. Whether it's a rising and eventually a contending team is to be determined.
The council will evaluate stipends in two weeks.
The Blazers saw the debut of Wallace, who was acquired from Charlotte seven minutes before Thursday's trade deadline in exchange for Portland centers Joel Przybilla and Sean Marks, forward Dante Cunningham and two conditional first-round draft picks.

Nonetheless, Friday's report was weak across multiple categories. Construction employment fell slightly. Manufacturing employment, an area of strength in recent months, grew by a disappointing 16,000 jobs. Even as employers added jobs last month, full-time employment actually fell by 812,000.
The Easter holiday slowed down street re-openings, Dennis said.

The takeaway: N.C. State is still recovering from its ACC semifinal loss to North Carolina, when coach Mark Gottfried wasn't aware that standout player C.J. Leslie had picked up his fourth foul. Instead of taking Leslie out -- as Gottfried would have done -- the sophomore remained on the court and picked up his fifth foul less than a minute later, with 8:03 still to play.

Director Christopher Alden’s production of the Mozart opera--a U.S. premiere in 2001-- had some elegant touches and was fun, if sometimes a little too cute.

It’s time for local laws to reflect common sense and reality. Peachtree City and its cart paths are no longer a closed system. Between 1995 and 2010, 24 subdivisions that border Peachtree City have authorized golf carts on their residential streets, connecting where possible to the city paths. This allows more residents to get to schools, golf courses, shopping centers and other places of common necessity without using expensive gas or adding to traffic congestion. It’s smart, practical and (let’s admit it) just plain fun. Golf carts are safe and more environmentally friendly than cars, and their use should be encouraged.

An additional $10,000 was tacked on to the total because Bryce Peters failed to secure an Ohio business license.
The scandal provoked criticism that Penn State officials didn't do enough to stop Sandusky, and it prompted the ouster of legendary football coach Joe Paterno and the school's longtime president, Graham Spanier.
The FedExCup was one of several issues the first Umpqua Bank Challenge dealt with as it was put together almost on the fly. After Peter Jacobsen Sports saw the Jeld-Wen Tradition - a Champions Tour major it ran for eight years in Oregon - leave for Alabama, Jacobsen sought to bring another event to his home state.
Industry sources said the paper could be losing up to $30 million a year. Zuckerman acknowledges the paper is bleeding red ink, but claims the losses are not that high.

"It was a hard series against a very good team," Rangers coach John Tortorella said. "I thought both teams went toe to toe in all areas of the game. Sometimes the first round is the hardest round. That's all this is, one round."
Statistics show they tend to delay marriage but not children. So this downturn might amp up the number of single moms who, on average, are more likely to lean on their families and the government to make the rent and stock the pantry.
They faced up to the city's uncontrollable financial decline, and to city government's long-running inability to right things on its own. They embraced a consent agreement that will bring the council, Mayor Dave Bing and the state together around a shared governance model that leaves local democracy intact -- but with tough financial oversight.
If Michigan's working people want real change, without getting back-stabbed in the wallet, as Snyder did to us, vote for Ron Paul.
During a recent editorial board session at the Times, Sweeney, D-3, of West Deptford Township, said his plan to provide a 10 percent property tax credit to households with incomes below $250,000 makes more sense than Christie’s proposed income tax cut for residents at all income levels.

Here's a breakdown of the bills involved in the bill of rights:
Nearly everything in the house has a connection either to Scott's personal family history or to the home's place in St. Louis history. The inspiration of his grandmother, Missouri native Lena Wilson Hepper, is everywhere, especially the kitchen, where Scott has her cast iron frying pans and pottery crocks on display and uses her old mason jars as his drinking glasses. She also inspired his artwork, which is proudly displayed throughout the home. A painter herself, Scott's grandmother put a paintbrush in his hand at a young age. He continues to develop his skill but only creates art to enjoy, not to sell.

Right now Santana's arm is blessing and a curse.
That would be true had Santorum's campaign submitted delegate slates there. Regardless, the campaign is chalking up the potentially devastating blunder to spotty organization late last year, when all efforts were focused on Iowa -- Santorum ultimately won the caucuses there -- and the candidate was still a long shot.
At Chanticleer, a public garden in Wayne, Pa., pansies and violas are planted alongside lettuces, mustards and cabbages. This year, a flower bed at the entrance pairs luminescent Brazen Brass mustard with a peach-cupped Katie Heath daffodil, salmon-colored Serenity Rose Magic African daisies and copper-colored wallflowers. The effect, says staff horticulturist Jonathan Wright, is "electric."
"It's not official, of course," Rosenblatt said Friday. "But it's my belief that all of the board members felt very strongly we're going to proceed (with a bond measure)."

Flights are on Cathay or its affiliate, Dragonair. Base pass prices apply to midweek transpacific flights; add-ons are available from other U.S. cities and for weekend travel, extended stays, and flights to additional Asian destinations as far away as Dubai.

“We anticipated he could get back to who he was,” Girardi said. “There are no guarantees. There are no guarantees when a guy's 39-years-old and he's taken a year and a half off. But I do know Andy's work ethic, and I do know what he's all about. If anyone can do it, I believe he can do it.”
In New Jersey, we strive to provide better health care with less cost. President Obama’s plan does the reverse and cuts $3,700 worth of benefits for certain senior citizens, according to the Heritage Foundation, which estimated that lower-income earners and minorities would be hit hardest.That’s as responsible as sending up a hitter to face a 100 mph fastball without a helmet.Obamacare also places new taxes on health devices such as hearing aids, imaging machines, replacement hips and even the common tongue depressor. These costs will be passed on to consumers and have a chilling effect on the industry’s research and development budgets, meaning less innovation in this very important field. The billions of dollars’ worth of taxes added to insurers, prescriptions and medical devices will mean higher prices and fewer choices for patients. Some taxes will come right out of their pockets.
For a long time, that had not been a possibility. While probiotics were found in foods like yogurt, they did not survive extreme temperatures, so putting them in frozen or baked goods was out.

"Its important to know stroke survivors always have the potential for growth and achievement."
Rep. Vicki Berger, a Salem Republican and co-chair of the House Revenue Committee, opened Tuesday's floor debate with a blunt assessment: "Our estate tax code, as currently written, is a confusing mess. This bill is about having a workable tax system in place. ... It doesn't address whether there should be a tax at all."
Harkless did that despite being in foul trouble the entire game. He did that despite having to beat a taller defender, then an even taller second defender. He did that from in the lane and outside the 3-point line.

Norman has spent virtually his entire life with the company. As a teenager, he rode around the desert bareback on his horse Birdie, rounding up cows. And after serving in the Army Air Forces during World War II and graduating from the University of Arizona, he joined the company in 1949. His son Kent became president and chief operating officer in 1992.
It is ironic that The Sun titled its editorial on voter ID laws "The phantom menace" (Feb. 27). The "Phantom Menace" in the Star Wars trilogy actually refers to a dark force in politics that hides in plain sight pretending to be a public servant.
George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer, told police Martin looked suspicious because he was wearing a hoodie and admitted to shooting the teenager. He said he acted in self-defense and has not been charged.
Answer: I was feeling extremely burned out. I think a lot of it was because of some decisions I had made over the course of the last two years and taking on some things that stacked up to the point where I felt like my whole life was being consumed by the job and thinking about it 24/7.

"When you look at it, it looks pretty dangerous because you're behind the wheel of a car when most kids don't even have their licenses," Bohn said. "But when you see how we're strapped in - we have straps going everywhere, coming down and across so tight - that we can hardly move. Plus a helmet, fire suit, and neck brace so we're pretty well covered."

Gavin DeGraw so annoyed his pro partner Karina Smirnoff in rehearsals that she was shown getting duct tape to put over his mouth so she wouldn't have to listen to him. But on the dance floor, he danced his best yet, tangoing to the Rolling Stones. At one point, the two fell to the floor, but that seemed to be part of the choreography. Len said he "liked it," citing the flair and attitude. Bruno said it was "a little messy in the corner." Carrie Ann said she felt like she was watching "Johnny Depp ... you sold it to me." Scores: 8, 8, 7 = 23
A recurring theme of the evening was the relocation of African American communities and other communities of color out of Portland and into east Multnomah County, and the lack of services that are available in the area.
"I think the policy that's been adopted in New Jersey, especially in recent years, has been highly unconstructive for the region," he told the Daily News. "They are basically just giving away public resources for companies who move from one part of the region to another."

Paula is recovering from thumb surgery; Karen, from finger surgery. They are two of the classiest people I have met in sports, and I wish them both the best.
Boop is so down on gas grills, he pretty much refuses to use them. "I'd rather be a vegetarian than ruin a good piece of meat," he told me just yesterday. Look, don't pay too much attention to Boop. He's a "professional," as he likes to remind me, having worked in his late teens as a pit man at a Lompoc BBQ joint called the Cooperage. (Don't bother looking for it; it's now an Italian restaurant.) Anyway, if you're stuck with gas-lava-charcoal, try using some of those expensive wood chips they sell at BBQ stores, or rip that loose board off your neighbor's fence.
Senior Obama campaign aide David Axelrod sought to play down any differences between Biden and the president, writing on Twitter that Biden was saying that "all married couples should have exactly the same legal rights."

To get to the heart of "Lost" country, visitors take a drive familiar to generations of surfers, up over the saddle roads that cut through the heart of Oahu. Past the Army's famed Schofield Barracks, the Dole Pineapple Plantation Visitors Center and acres of what used to be sugar cane fields. The road eventually dips down to the town of Haleiwa.
One rule specifically bans cheating, cheating devices or the use of electronics while playing. However, card counting without the use of devices -- a tactic successful gamblers use but is typically frowned upon by casinos -- will not be illegal.

The animated Disney film, on which the musical is based, handled the mix of grownup themes and kiddie fare with aplomb; the stage version isn't always as successful. It can't help but be jarring when against a backdrop of exquisitely designed costumes, flowing dance moves and that hypnotic African chanting to suddenly have a squawking bird crack a one-liner. (Though it must be pointed out that Mark David Kaplan, as the bird Zazu, expertly squawks and sputters like a classic Vaudevillian ham.)

The most important thing about them these days, though, is their role in job creation. Since 1980, businesses less than five years old have accounted for all of the net job creation in America. The fast-growing ones create 10 percent of all new jobs even though they account for only 1 percent of all companies. Without entrepreneurs, job growth in America would be doomed.
Several weeks ago, 72-year-old Diane Pieczynski and her husband paid $1,900 and upgraded their old Weber charcoal kettle grill to one of its top-of-the-line gas models in stainless steel. It has a built-in wood-chip smoker box, retractable rotisserie, searing burner and lighted control knobs. "It's a beautiful thing," says Mrs. Pieczynski of Frankfort, Ill., who insists she'll be doing most of the grilling. "If you cook in your house all of your life, this isn't any different."

Cataract Canyon: From Laurel Dell picnic site, turn left on the Cataract Trail for a 1-mile descent into the canyon to see Cataract Falls, a series of pretty cascade-type waterfalls in a lush setting. The trail leads all the way down to Bolinas-Fairfax Road (670 feet elevation) west of Alpine Dam (parking areas fills up here Sunday mornings). The canyon's prettiest falls are at an elevation range of about 1,200 to 1,400 feet, within 0.5 to 0.75 miles. After spring rains recharge the watershed, the canyon rates a 10. It's like two hikes in one, with different views on your ways down and up.

Prosecutors allege defendants Hai Yan Jiang, 32, and Lin Wu, 43, talked about importing fake cosmetics. Wu asked if the products could be safely used, and Yan at one point allegedly said, "All I care about is to make money, other things do not matter." Wu said "Business needs to be done with a clear conscience," to which, authorities say, Yan replied, "Then go be a monk."

The minute the Broncos won more than five games, however, they likely dropped out of the first-round real estate they would need to get Richardson. The difficult side for the Broncos is this draft is full of smaller backs, guys like Oregon's LaMichael James and Miami's Lamar Miller.
"When people talk about strength of schedule, you have to remember it can change dramatically," Fox said. "We went worst to first. San Francisco and the turnaround they had.

This is the low end of the drug chain, and Quarles and Duffy try to exploit it to get Givens out of their hair. He easily foils the plan -- outsmarting dopers is child’s play for Givens -- but can’t stop them from turning on each other.

Sotheby's auction of Wallis and Edward's personal effects in 1998 becomes the bridge between the two stories. Wally becomes obsessed with the collection, lingering so long that you may wonder why she's not arrested. Instead, one of the security guards, Evgeni (Oscar Isaac), falls for her. When Wally's defiance and discontent finally do take shape, she decides she might be so bold as to bid on something. Shopping as liberation; an auction paddle lifted in protest, not exactly the stuff of feminist dreams.

Rarely have the words film noir and "The Great Gatsby" been used in the same sentence. Fitzgerald's 1925 masterwork set during the Jazz Age on Long Island and New York revolves around Jay Gatsby, a mysterious millionaire who gained his wealth as a bootlegger and loves the beautiful but married Daisy Buchanan.

However, many patients remain fearful of the test, due to its uncomfortable, laxative-based preparation and its cost (when not covered by insurance). In an effort to give patients another colon cancer screening option, researchers at CWRU have developed an alternative, marketed as Colosure. In 2009, the American Cancer Society added DNA testing to its colon cancer screening guidelines.
"It's still in a crouch," Zito said of his delivery. "My weight is back a little more."
McGinest undecided: A source close to Browns free agent linebacker Willie McGinest said he'd return in 2009 for the right opportunity. McGinest said before the 2008 season that he'd retire after the year. But he was noncommittal even after the season finale in Pittsburgh. McGinest and Browns coach Eric Mangini were in New England together, but it's not known if Mangini is interested in re-signing him.
Within the extensive menu, the soups we tried - including the Seafood Noodle Soup, rice noodles with succulent shrimp, squid, scallop and aromatic fish balls ($9) - were well-crafted and nicely balanced. The Saigon-signature Pho ($11), arguably the national dish of Vietnam, is a credit to its country and its local cook. The meal in a giant soup bowl is classically perfect, a steaming beefy broth made fragrantly delicious with the rich roasted flavors of cinnamon, ginger and anise, filled almost to the brim with tender soup-cooked slices of rare beef, delightfully chewy beef meatballs, flavorful brisket and silken rice noodles. With the traditional self-customizing accoutrement of bean sprouts, hot peppers, lime wedges, Thai basil sprigs, hoisin and chili sauces to add as you go, it becomes an over-flowing bowl of sheer goodness.
The very existence of the commission, critics also contend, perpetuates the image of the port as corrupt and mobbed up.
Recently a Muslim woman taken to a jail for nonpayment of a traffic ticket had her head scarf (hijab) forcibly removed for security clearance. The woman tried to explain that the hijab was part of her dress and she could not take it off due to religious reasons.
Gilbert Ramos, 45, shot his wife, Sandra Thompson-Ramos, 37, their son Nicholas, 10, and daughter Emma, 8, in the head before turning the gun on himself, Pinal County Sheriff's Office spokesman Tim Gaffney said.
Who among us, finding ourselves in Bing's circumstances, would not devoutly wish for such a heroic deliverance?
Famous examples of social art include Spencer Tunick's photos depicting thousands of nude subjects at locations around the world, and Nek Chand's "Rock Garden," a vast sculpture garden in India. But the trend is magnified in Detroit because so many artists are zeroing in on the same subject matter and displaying their creations in high-profile ways.

They are people like Stan Hall, 78, of Townsend, a small town in northern Wisconsin. He wasn't in the experiment, but his artery disease was caught by the gene test, which was recommended by his doctor because he was suffering from unexplained fatigue. He didn't have traditional symptoms yet wound up having seven blockages fixed.
"More speed, more tenacity," Hitchcock said. "It's going to take a lot of that to beat LA. They've got it going with four lines and this gives us more tenacity, more speed and more hammer on the forecheck. D'Agostini was a great help for us (in Game 2) and we like (Sobotka) coming from the middle of the ice, so just trying to get better with our own group here."
Army Capt. Jason Wright, one of Mohammed's Pentagon-appointed lawyers, declined to comment on the case.
Nevertheless, 29 games into the season, all are on the positive side of the plus-minus equator, led by Alex Pietrangelo's plus-10 and Kris Russell's plus-9. Combined, the seven active defensemen are a plus-45. And what coach Ken Hitchcock has enjoyed most about his formative few has been their resilience.
Lower ratings could prompt risk-averse institutions to withdraw deposits with banks. In addition, banks likely will be forced to put up additional collateral on derivatives transactions and in certain investment vehicles, including those housing pools of securitized assets, if their ratings are cut.
But more on that later. First, a review of the carnage.
Christie, who's endorsed Romney, says he thinks Romney will beat Rick Santorum <U+0097> and that would lessen chances of a convention fight.
In Los Angeles County, jail deputies do not have televisions in their guard stations.
The lagging campaigns of Texas Rep. Ron Paul and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich got votes, and polling officials said at least a few voters said they were Democrats but asked for Republican ballots.
We’ll get this out of the way first — Floyd has three alcohol-related arrests since 2009, something that is no doubt on the top of his file and something he was grilled about to no end during the combine process. Whether it costs him a few spots remains to be seen. But on the field, there are arguments to be made that Floyd is a better natural receiver than Blackmon. He has tremendous hands and the ability to make show-stopping catches anywhere on the field. Keep in mind, too, that he was double teamed at Notre Dame more often than not.
Bar service: Full service with a very good but expensive wine list (few bottles under $35) and inventive, original cocktails.
Whether this latest injury severely hurts OSU's defense depends a lot on what Banker's crew is able to work out along the line. After all, an inexperienced corner needs, above all else, a good defensive line in front of him.
She moved in just months after her building opened. Although it had ample communal space a kitchen, a community room, TV and computer rooms, sitting areas and a large patio most residents stayed in their rooms, she said.
Although I had been using the term "rape" in conversation to describe the Penn State incident, I had not considered other language we rely on to describe sexual assault. Terms such as "had sex with" or "fondled" do sound awfully benign when you are talking about people being forced into acts against their will.
The schedule for the rest of the song debuts is:
The two traded a pair of breaks in the first set, and Djokovic led 5-4 in the tiebreaker until three unforced errors — a backhand and two forehands — gave Federer the set.
‘’The initial focus of this investigation has been to determine who was responsible for remotely activating the camera in the dormitory room of the student and then transmitting the encounter on the Internet,’’ Middlesex County Prosecutor Bruce Kaplan said in a statement released this evening.
If only the lessons we learn as we age could be applied earlier in life.
The $400 million gambling house is scheduled to open in late 2012.
dealer hits S17
For Pontiacs, servicing will continue at GM dealers. The catch is that the auto maker has notified 1,100 dealers that their contracts won't be renewed next year, meaning owners might need to travel farther depending on where they live.
That was then.
20. Tampa Bay, Adrian Clayborn, DE, Iowa
Over the past few years, lawmakers have eliminated state funding for the program, but funding from the voter-approved First Things First early-childhood program made up most of the cuts.
In Oslo, Obama emphasized that in the face of these unconscionable acts, we simply can't let humanity move backward. And as the centerpiece to his campaign, he repeated his impassioned call to those of all religions to struggle against what separates us from one another, and to recognize, beneath the veil of difference, the common humanity that binds us together.
Kirby and Pentagon press secretary George Little said Liang's trip has been long planned and they know of no discussions about the letter and would not link it to the visit in any way.
They didn't have much problem against Hochevar.
For the most part, the Disney cruise regulars I spoke to marveled at the Dream, calling it bigger, brighter and better than its older cousins, with many more bells and whistles.

Teammate Ryan Siegler shot 38, followed by Shane Cowan (40), Kevin Murphy (41) and James Nabial (41).
The most interesting part of the report, though, covers what's known as the rockets-and-feathers phenomenon: Gasoline prices seem to go up rapidly, but come down slowly. In formal economist-speak, this is called "asymmetric price adjustment."
Aretha Franklin is one of six people who'll be inducted into the Hall on Aug. 14 in Hendersonville, Tenn. She'll be joined by bluegrass legend Ricky Skaggs, family group The Hoppers, contemporary Christian singer Dallas Holm, the late TV evangelist Rex Humbard and Christian rock band Love Song.
Lot attendants would not have to be licensed security guards. But they would receive police training so that they serve effectively as "eyes and ears."
Have to give it to the self-proclaimed "worldwide leader" because just as you can buy a Rose Bowl ticket or commemorative scarf in Pasadena today, you can apparently buy anything for the right price. The sports-television network has managed to buy exclusive access for a half-billion dollars.
øThe Fever, smartly in hindsight, kept three point guards on their 11-man roster: January, Erin Phillips and Shannon Bobbitt. Phillips, acquired in a three-way trade with Seattle and Washington before the start of training camp, stepped in for January as the starter and hasn't missed a beat, averaging 8.6 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.4 assists.
Joseph Schlafly, a senior vice president at Stifel Nicolaus who heads the investment firm's venture-capital efforts, says the region's shortcomings are most acute for the companies just emerging from the lab.
Regna Merritt, who has been working the Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility to protect the city's drinking water, argues that this is precisely the language that provides cover, not oversight, for commissioners who can't keep their mitts off restricted funds, despite the admonitions of the city auditor, city attorneys and city ratepayers.
"I never done this before," he said. "I'm never doing it again ... too crowded."
Brungardt: You can kind of see Tatum's eyes, she was licking her chops. This girl is throwing me outside, inside, outside, inside. And if she goes back inside, I'm going to turn on it. She waited for the right pitch and hit it, and it made the difference in the game.
"I mix it up a lot and I rarely throw the same pitch twice (in a row) except for the fastball," Vanyo said. "I try to keep hitters off balance.

More jobs should result from $267 million in stimulus money to weatherize the homes of low-income owners.
“Time to shut up, fat boy!” Jacobs yelled.
Watts, the Penn psychologist, said the accountability system incentivizes the wrong things. If the district delivered more services to children in need, it would see a reduction in violence, she said.
True, some of this is down to bad luck rather than bad judgment. The BOE couldn't have been expected to predict last year's escalation in the euro crisis or the Arab Spring. But the BOE must take the blame for grossly over-estimating the impact of sterling's devaluation. It has also badly under-estimated the weakness of the money supply: Despite pumping £325 billion ($523.98 billion) into the economy, equivalent to 20% of GDP, the U.K. broad money supply suffered its biggest quarterly drop in February since records began in 1963. Add the BOE's failure to predict the crisis—even in May 2008 it was still attaching a virtual zero probability of a recession—and it is clear something is wrong with its models.
His best outing of the season was his 22-carry, 166-yard game against the Carolina Panthers on Oct. 10. And here's an alarming pattern: In the Bears' five losses, Forte averaged 11 carries for 38 yards and scored only one touchdown.
She said nothing at this level makes her nervous any longer. But the Olympics, which she's been asked about since she started running?
For the 6-foot-4 Covington, the home needed to feel open and airy while utilizing every nook and cranny. Space planning - his specialty as a former restaurant designer - was key. He added light with reeded-glass interior doors and clerestory windows, skylights and a more open floor plan.
Teachers may haul a parent into school three times or more a year for special, one-on-one meetings to discuss specific academic or behavior problems or challenges with a child, and parents are expected to follow up by taking specific, prescribed corrective actions.
For Day 102, I did a treadmill while watching a few of the latter innings of the Indians' game. I jogged for eight minutes -- the first time I have jogged in two-plus months. A strained muscle in my back, then a pulled quad, kept me on the sideline. Thanks largely to the amazing work of massotherapist Karen Chorba, I have made tremendous progress on both fronts. I cannot imagine where I would be without Karen, whom I have known for years and who has helped expedite my healing from more than a couple of injuries.
Boswell Engineering officials said the study had looked at the cost of maintaining the sewer systems under a proposed regionalization plan, they believe was proposed by Christiansen.
For months, staff met clients in trailers and an RV just feet from the blackened building. Clients were dispersed to other Cascadia clinics and to temporary clinics set up at the Salvation Army and a church nearby.

BOONTON — Getting around New Jersey’s flooded highways this week had been equal parts Ferdinand Magellan and Thomas Edison.
They've paid a price for being true to their art, though. Stop-motion animators collected in Portland in the late 1990s, when Will Vinton Studios produced a pair of stop-motion TV shows: "The PJs" and "Gary & Mike."
But more movie choices don't necessarily mean more moviegoers, who perhaps thanks to an improving economy have been turning out in greater numbers than expected. In a particularly notable event, three high-profile films that opened on the same weekend — "The Vow,""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"and "Safe House" — all turned out to be hits.
Matthew Davis tells us he doesn’t care what you think about the records he likes. But don’t judge him on that — judge him by what he’s willing to spin at parties. On the ambitious “Last Glittering Thrill,” he hands us a playlist, singing about the old Three O’Clock and Plasticland records on his turntable. Those bands made sharply written psychedelic guitar-pop — immersive, urgent, occasionally murky and pleasantly skewed. He’s chased — and captured — those virtues himself on “Believe in Sound,” the debut album by his latest outfit, the Thousand Pities. A longtime Garden State resident who now lives in Montclair, Davis has made some talented friends in Jersey pop: Stanley Demeski of the Feelies plays percussion on the brief “From the Air,” Deena Shoshkes of the Cucumbers sings harmony on the engrossing “Point Pleasant.” Davis’ regular band is awfully impressive, too, especially powerhouse drummer Ken Meyer and synth player Billy Donohue, who adds twinkle and purr to the occasionally downcast material. As for Davis himself, he possesses an emotionally resonant, weather-beaten voice that he puts to good use on ballads “Super-High Moon” and “Gone to Stay.” One of the best local releases of 2011 so far? Heck, forget about “local.”
Small businesses, which once considered the Yellow Pages a must-buy, have found other ways to get the word out to neighborhood customers. Google, Facebook and Groupon have sucked up ad dollars that once went into the phone book.

Star magazine, which obtained Lohan's diary, says she wrote at the time of his death, "Today Heath died. I'm in love with him. He was the love of my life. He taught me so much, and he was everything I've ever wanted and more."
Who knows what Urlacher is like outside of football? But Urlacher's public persona today is what a star professional athlete should be. He still won't give you deep thoughts if he doesn't have any. But he seems to be comfortable enough in his own skin that he doesn't take every criticism as an insult.
Smart said the loss would serve as motivation to everyone in the VCU locker room except lone senior Bradford Burgess, who won't be back next year.
The leagues provide sports opportunities for seventh- and eighth-graders at Lake Oswego Junior High. The Parent Club holds fund-raisers and provides support for students' extracurricular activities.
"We're all partners on this movie," said producer Todd Lieberman. "We grew up on The Muppets, but these guys have been living it for 20 years. They know these characters better than any of us possibly could because they've been doing it for 20 years. They know the characters, and they know the style. They know what to do and what not to do for the brand."
Who are these guys? I am referring of course to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company. It must be great to be in full control while remaining one of the untouchables. Lemmee e'splain.
Cablevision Chairman Charles Dolan later submitted a $700 million bid for the team that was rejected as "untimely."

This animation started after reviewing data collected in the initial Detroit Works town hall meetings. The idea was simple: experts are asking for input on complex issues and Detroiters need a straightforward explanation of the problem that makes sense if you aren<U+0092>t an urban planner. The goal of this animation is to provide citizens with enough background information to begin to tackle these conversations.
Let them claim it, he said, as long as they honor cab drivers everywhere, whom he calls "the first line of defense against loneliness and isolation."
